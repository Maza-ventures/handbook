# Robotics Overview

*Hardware meets software in the real world*

Robotics startups are the hardest type of startup to build successfully. You have all the challenges of software startups plus manufacturing, supply chains, regulatory approval, and physical distribution. The time from idea to revenue is measured in years, not months.

So why do it? Because when robotics startups work, they can create enormous value and strong competitive moats.

## What Makes Robotics Different

**Long development cycles.** You can't ship a broken robot and patch it later. Hardware iteration cycles are measured in months, not days.

**Capital intensive.** You need money for R&D, manufacturing, inventory, and working capital. Bootstrapping is nearly impossible.

**Regulatory complexity.** Many robotic applications require safety certifications, which take time and money.

**Real-world messiness.** Software operates in clean, predictable environments. Robots operate in the chaotic physical world.

## Types of Robotics Startups

**Industrial automation.** Robots for factories, warehouses, and logistics. B2B sales, proven ROI models.

**Service robots.** Cleaning, delivery, security, agriculture. Often B2B but sometimes consumer.

**Consumer robots.** Home automation, entertainment, personal assistance. Hardest market but potentially largest.

**Autonomous vehicles.** Cars, trucks, drones, boats. Highly regulated but huge markets.

## The Robotics Advantage

**Physical moats.** Once you solve a complex robotics problem, it's hard for competitors to copy quickly.

**Data collection.** Robots in the real world generate unique datasets that improve performance over time.

**Integration barriers.** Custom robotics solutions become deeply integrated into customer operations.

**First-mover advantages.** Early robotics companies can establish strong positions in nascent markets.

## Common Robotics Mistakes

**Solving problems that don't exist.** Just because you can build a robot doesn't mean anyone needs it.

**Underestimating software complexity.** Modern robots are more software than hardware. Don't neglect the software side.

**Ignoring manufacturing costs.** Your prototype cost doesn't matter. Your manufacturing cost determines your business model.

**Timing the market wrong.** Robotics adoption follows predictable patterns. Understand where your market is in the cycle.

## The Robotics Development Process

**Year 1: Research and prototyping.** Prove the core technology works in controlled conditions.

**Year 2-3: Product development.** Build working prototypes that operate in real-world conditions.

**Year 4-5: Pilot deployments.** Get early customers to test your robots in their environments.

**Year 6+: Scale manufacturing.** Once product-market fit is proven, scale production and distribution.

This timeline assumes everything goes well. It usually takes longer.

## Funding Robotics Startups

**Pre-seed/Seed ($1-5M).** Prove core technology, build initial prototypes.

**Series A ($5-20M).** Develop working products, get first customers.

**Series B ($20-50M).** Scale manufacturing, expand market reach.

**Growth rounds ($50M+).** International expansion, new product lines.

Robotics startups typically need more money at each stage than software startups.

## Market Timing

**Too early:** The technology isn't ready, costs are too high, regulations don't exist.

**Too late:** Established players dominate, switching costs are high, innovation slows.

**Just right:** Technology is proven but not commoditized, early adopters are ready, regulations are clarifying.

Most successful robotics startups launch when the technology becomes "good enough" for real applications but before it becomes commoditized.

## Getting Started

Don't start with the robot. Start with the problem. Find a task that:
- Is currently done by humans
- Is dangerous, repetitive, or expensive
- Has measurable ROI when automated
- Doesn't require human-level intelligence

Then ask: is this the right time to solve this problem with robotics?

If yes, you might have a robotics startup. If no, wait or find a different problem.

The hardware is the easy part. Everything else is hard.
