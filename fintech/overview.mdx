# Fintech Overview

*Money makes everything more complicated*

Fintech is one of the fastest-growing startup categories, but also one of the most regulated. Every fintech startup is really two startups: the technology company and the financial services company. You need to excel at both.

The opportunity is enormous. Financial services is a massive industry with incumbent players that move slowly. But the barriers to entry are high, and the consequences of mistakes can be severe.

## What Makes Fintech Different

**Heavy regulation.** You're dealing with people's money, which means compliance, licensing, and regulatory oversight.

**Trust is paramount.** Financial products require higher trust than other software. Security breaches can be company-ending.

**Network effects are common.** Many fintech products become more valuable as more people use them.

**Unit economics are tricky.** You might make money on fees, interest, interchange, or subscriptions. Often it's a combination.

## Types of Fintech Startups

**Payments.** Processing, sending, and receiving money. High volume, low margins.

**Lending.** Personal loans, business loans, mortgages, credit. Higher margins but more risk.

**Investing.** Trading platforms, robo-advisors, wealth management. Regulated but scalable.

**Banking.** Digital banks, neobanks, embedded banking. Core infrastructure plays.

**Insurance.** Underwriting, claims processing, new insurance products. Slow-moving but large markets.

**B2B fintech.** Tools for other financial companies. Often the easiest way to start in fintech.

## The Fintech Regulatory Landscape

**Federal regulators.** SEC, CFTC, OCC, FDIC, Fed. Different products face different regulators.

**State regulators.** Money transmission licenses, lending licenses. You might need licenses in all 50 states.

**Compliance requirements.** KYC, AML, fraud prevention, data security. Not optional.

**Partner bank relationships.** Many fintech companies partner with licensed banks rather than getting their own licenses.

## Common Fintech Mistakes

**Underestimating regulatory requirements.** Compliance isn't something you add later. Build it in from day one.

**Ignoring fraud and security.** Financial products are targets for sophisticated bad actors.

**Poor unit economics.** Many fintech startups lose money on every customer and try to make it up in volume.

**Launching too broadly.** Start with one specific financial use case and do it exceptionally well.

## The Fintech Advantage

**Incumbents are slow.** Traditional financial companies have legacy systems and risk-averse cultures.

**Consumer expectations are rising.** People expect financial products to work like modern consumer apps.

**Data creates moats.** Financial data enables better underwriting, fraud detection, and personalization.

**Network effects can be strong.** Payment networks, lending marketplaces, and trading platforms all benefit from network effects.

## Building Trust in Fintech

**Security first.** Use best practices for data encryption, access controls, and system architecture.

**Transparency.** Be clear about fees, risks, and how you make money.

**Compliance.** Follow all applicable regulations, even when they slow you down.

**Customer service.** When people have problems with their money, they need fast, helpful support.

## Go-to-Market for Fintech

**Start with a niche.** Don't try to be a bank for everyone. Be the best solution for a specific customer segment.

**Leverage existing relationships.** Partner with companies that already have your target customers.

**Content marketing.** Financial literacy content builds trust and drives organic growth.

**Referral programs.** Happy customers are your best marketing channel in fintech.

## Metrics That Matter

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).** How much does it cost to get a new customer?

**Lifetime Value (LTV).** How much revenue will a customer generate over their lifetime?

**Unit economics.** Are you making money on each customer after all costs?

**Regulatory capital.** Do you have enough capital to meet regulatory requirements?

## Getting Started

Start by identifying a financial pain point you've experienced personally. Then research:
- What regulations apply to this problem?
- Who are the current solutions and why do they suck?
- Can you solve this without becoming a bank?
- What's the path to profitability on each customer?

If you can answer these questions positively, you might have a fintech startup.

The key is starting small and specific. Every successful fintech company started by solving one narrow problem exceptionally well.
