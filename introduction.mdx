# The Pragmatic Startup Guide

A few months ago, I was talking to a founder who'd just raised a Series A. His startup was doing well, but he said something that stuck with me: "I wish someone had told me earlier that most startup advice is either wrong or doesn't apply to my type of company."

He was right. Most startup writing treats all startups as if they're the same. But a SaaS company faces completely different challenges than a robotics startup. An AI company's path to product-market fit looks nothing like a fintech's. Yet we keep giving generic advice as if one size fits all.

This guide is different. It's organized around the types of startups you might actually start, not abstract principles that sound good in blog posts. Each section contains the specific knowledge you need for that type of company, written by people who've built them.

But first, some universal truths.

## What Doesn't Change

Despite what VCs tell you at conferences, most startup fundamentals haven't changed much. You still need to:

- Solve a real problem for real people
- Build something people want 
- Figure out how to make money
- Get customers to pay you more than it costs to serve them

Everything else is tactics. Important tactics, but tactics nonetheless.

The reason startup advice feels so contradictory is that the tactics vary enormously by type of company. B2B sales cycles work differently than consumer virality. Hardware has different constraints than software. AI companies face regulatory risks that SaaS companies don't.

## How This Guide Works

This guide is structured around startup archetypes. Each section covers a different type of company: SaaS, AI, infrastructure, robotics, fintech, and others.

Within each section, you'll find:

- **The fundamentals** - What makes this type of startup different
- **Common mistakes** - Where founders typically go wrong
- **Success patterns** - What works, based on companies that made it
- **Resources** - Books, essays, and tools specific to this domain

The goal isn't to give you a paint-by-numbers approach to startups. It's to help you understand the particular constraints and opportunities of the type of company you're building, so you can make better decisions.

## A Note on Timing

One thing that's changed dramatically is how fast you need to move. The window between "this is possible" and "this is competitive" has shrunk from years to months. This is especially true in AI, but it's happening everywhere.

This doesn't mean you should skip planning or rush to market with a broken product. It means you need to be more deliberate about what you choose to build and how you validate it.

## Getting Started

If you're not sure what type of startup you want to build, start with the Essentials section. It covers the fundamentals that apply regardless of domain: finding ideas, choosing co-founders, timing, and execution.

If you already know what you're building, jump to the relevant section. Each one assumes you understand the basics but goes deep on domain-specific knowledge.

The best startup advice is specific. Let's get specific.
