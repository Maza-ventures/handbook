# Building

*How to build products people want*

Building is the part most founders think they understand. You write code, design interfaces, ship features. But building a startup product is different from building any other kind of software.

Startup products need to solve real problems, delight users, and enable sustainable business models. Most importantly, they need to do this while you're learning what the real problems actually are.

## The Build Trap

Most founders fall into the build trap: they think their job is to build features. It's not. Your job is to learn what to build.

Building without learning is just an expensive hobby. Learning without building is just research. You need both.

## Building for Learning

**Start with the riskiest assumptions.** What has to be true for your startup to succeed? Test those things first.

**Build the minimum viable product (MVP).** Not the minimum shippable product. The minimum thing that teaches you something important.

**Measure what matters.** Don't just track usage. Track behavior that indicates real value creation.

**Talk to users constantly.** The product should be a conversation with your users, not a monologue.

## The Product Development Process

**Week 1: Define the hypothesis.** What problem are you solving? For whom? How will you know if it works?

**Week 2-3: Build the smallest thing that tests the hypothesis.** This might be a landing page, a prototype, or a manual process.

**Week 4: Get it in front of users.** Real users, not friends and family.

**Week 5: Analyze results and decide next steps.** Double down, pivot, or try something else.

Repeat this cycle constantly. Most successful products are the result of many small experiments, not one big build.

## Technical Decisions

**Choose boring technology.** Use proven tools and frameworks unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.

**Build for today's scale, not tomorrow's.** You probably won't have scaling problems. But if you do, that's a good problem to have.

**Optimize for learning speed.** Fast iteration beats perfect architecture in the early stages.

**Don't build what you can buy.** Authentication, payments, analytics - use existing services when possible.

## Quality vs. Speed

In the early stages, speed usually wins. But speed doesn't mean sloppy.

**What to optimize for speed:**
- Feature development
- User testing cycles
- Deployment processes
- Data collection

**What not to compromise on:**
- Security and privacy
- Core user experience
- Data integrity
- Legal compliance

## Building the Right Team

**Hire for skills you don't have.** If you're technical, your first hire should probably be business-focused, and vice versa.

**Hire people better than you.** Your team should make you the dumbest person in the room (in some areas).

**Cultural fit matters more early on.** Skills can be learned. Culture is harder to change.

**Remote is fine, but communication overhead is real.** Plan for it.

## Common Building Mistakes

**Building for edge cases.** Focus on the common use cases first. Edge cases can wait.

**Over-engineering the first version.** You'll probably rebuild it anyway once you understand the problem better.

**Not dogfooding your own product.** Use what you build. If you won't use it, why should anyone else?

**Ignoring performance.** Slow products don't get used, no matter how good the features are.

## When to Stop Building

**You have clear product-market fit.** Users are asking for features faster than you can build them.

**You need to focus on other areas.** Sometimes the product is good enough and growth/sales becomes the bottleneck.

**You're out of money.** Sometimes you need to take a different approach or find a different problem.

The hardest part of building is knowing when to stop building and start scaling. Most founders wait too long.

## The Building Mindset

Think of building as a conversation with reality. You have hypotheses about what users want. You build things to test those hypotheses. Reality gives you feedback. You adjust and try again.

The goal isn't to build the perfect product. It's to build something good enough that you can learn how to make it better.

Build, measure, learn, repeat.
