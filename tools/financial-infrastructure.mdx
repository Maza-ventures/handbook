Once you raise money, your financial infrastructure needs to evolve beyond basic bookkeeping. You need systems that can handle investor reporting, multi-currency operations, and scaling team expenses without creating administrative bottlenecks.

## Banking for Funded Startups

**Multiple account strategy:** You'll need accounts for different purposesâ€”operating expenses, payroll, tax reserves, and possibly separate accounts for different jurisdictions if you have international operations.

**International banking capabilities:** If you raised from international investors, you'll need to handle cross-border payments efficiently. This might mean accounts in multiple countries or banking partners with strong international capabilities.

**Credit facilities:** Most banks offer lines of credit or overdraft facilities to funded companies. These provide financial flexibility but require personal guarantees from founders in most MENA markets.

**Treasury management:** When you have significant cash on hand, you need strategies for managing it safely while maintaining liquidity for operations. This includes money market accounts, short-term deposits, or conservative investment options.

## Accounting Systems That Scale

**Professional accounting software:** QuickBooks and Xero work for early stages, but you might need more sophisticated systems like NetSuite as you grow. The key is choosing systems that integrate with your other business tools.

**Monthly financial close:** You need to produce accurate financial statements within 10-15 days of month-end. This requires systematic processes for recording transactions, reconciling accounts, and reviewing numbers.

**Multi-currency accounting:** If you operate in multiple countries, your accounting system needs to handle currency conversion, hedging gains/losses, and consolidated reporting in your functional currency.

**Revenue recognition:** Depending on your business model, you might need sophisticated systems for handling subscriptions, usage-based billing, or milestone-based revenue recognition.

## Investor Reporting Requirements

**Monthly investor updates:** Most investors expect regular updates on key metrics, financial performance, and business developments. This requires systematic data collection and presentation.

**Board reporting:** Quarterly board meetings require detailed financial reports, variance analysis, and forward-looking projections. Your accounting system should support these requirements.

**Annual audits:** Once you raise institutional capital, you'll likely need annual audited financial statements. Choose accounting practices and systems that facilitate audit processes.

**Compliance reporting:** Depending on your structure and investor base, you might have reporting requirements to multiple jurisdictions, regulatory bodies, or tax authorities.

## Finding Professional Financial Help

**When to hire a CFO vs. outsourced accounting:** Most companies need outsourced bookkeeping and part-time CFO services before they need full-time financial executives. A good fractional CFO can handle investor relations, financial planning, and strategic advice.

**Choosing accounting firms:** Look for firms that specialize in venture-backed companies and understand your industry. Generic accounting firms often struggle with startup-specific issues like stock-based compensation and revenue recognition.

**International tax planning:** Multi-jurisdiction operations create complex tax obligations. You need advisors who understand transfer pricing, tax treaties, and international compliance requirements.

**Banking relationship management:** Larger banks often assign relationship managers to funded companies. These relationships can provide access to credit facilities, foreign exchange services, and other financial products.

## Expense Management and Controls

**Corporate credit cards:** You need systematic ways to handle team expenses, travel, and vendor payments. Corporate cards with expense management software reduce administrative overhead.

**Approval workflows:** As your team grows, you need clear policies about spending authority, approval requirements, and expense documentation. This prevents budget overruns and ensures proper record-keeping.

**Vendor management:** Systematic processes for onboarding vendors, managing contracts, and handling payments. This includes legal review of significant vendor agreements.

**Payroll systems:** Multi-country operations often require different payroll providers for each jurisdiction. Choose systems that can handle equity compensation, benefits administration, and local compliance requirements.

## Cash Flow Management

**13-week rolling forecasts:** You need detailed cash flow projections that account for seasonal variations, customer payment patterns, and planned capital expenditures.

**Scenario planning:** Model your cash needs under different growth scenarios, sales cycles, and market conditions. This helps with fundraising timing and expense planning.

**Working capital optimization:** Understand your customer payment patterns, vendor payment terms, and inventory cycles (if applicable). Optimize these to improve cash flow.

**Currency hedging:** If you have significant foreign currency exposure, you might need hedging strategies to manage exchange rate risk.

**The Board-Ready Test**
Your financial systems should allow you to produce board-quality financial reports within two weeks of month-end without heroic efforts from your team.

## MENA-Specific Financial Considerations

**Islamic finance compliance:** If you have Sharia-compliant investors or operate in markets where Islamic finance principles matter, your financial structure and reporting might need to accommodate these requirements.

**Cross-border payment challenges:** Some MENA countries have restrictions on capital movements or foreign currency transactions. Plan your financial infrastructure to work within these constraints.

**Tax optimization across jurisdictions:** Different MENA countries have different tax rates, treaties, and incentives. Your financial structure should optimize for overall tax efficiency while maintaining compliance.

**Local banking relationships:** Even with international banking capabilities, you often need strong local banking relationships for day-to-day operations, government interactions, and business development.

## Red Flags in Financial Infrastructure

**Manual processes that don't scale:** If your financial processes require significant manual work each month, they'll break as you grow. Invest in automation early.

**Poor integration between systems:** Accounting software that doesn't integrate with your banking, payroll, or expense management creates ongoing reconciliation problems.

**Inadequate reporting capabilities:** If you can't easily produce the reports your investors and board members expect, you'll spend increasing amounts of time on financial administration.

**Insufficient internal controls:** As you handle more money and have more employees, you need proper segregation of duties, approval processes, and audit trails.

The goal is building financial infrastructure that scales with your growth without creating administrative bottlenecks. Good systems are expensive initially but save significant time and reduce errors as you grow.
