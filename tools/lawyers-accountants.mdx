Most law firms and accounting practices in MENA serve traditional businesses, not startups. Finding professionals who understand venture structures, international fundraising, and rapid growth requires knowing what questions to ask and what red flags to avoid.

## What to Look for in Startup Lawyers

**Experience with venture transactions:** Ask specifically about SAFE notes, convertible equity, and multi-jurisdiction structures. If they've never seen a YC SAFE or don't understand why you might need a Delaware holding company, keep looking.

**Speed and responsiveness:** Startups move fast. A lawyer who takes a week to review a simple NDA will become a bottleneck during fundraising. Test their responsiveness during initial conversations.

**Fixed-fee structures:** Avoid lawyers who only work on hourly billing for routine startup tasks. Good startup lawyers offer packages for incorporation, employee agreements, and standard fundraising documents.

**International connectivity:** If you plan to raise international capital, your lawyer needs relationships with US or UK firms who can handle cross-border transactions. Ask about their international network before you need it.

## Questions to Ask Potential Lawyers

- How many MENA startups have you helped incorporate in the past year?
- What's your standard fee for setting up a dual structure (local + Delaware)?
- Can you handle our first funding round, or will we need international counsel?
- How do you typically structure ongoing legal support for growing startups?
- What's your average turnaround time for reviewing investment documents?

## What to Look for in Startup Accountants

**Multi-jurisdiction experience:** MENA startups often operate across borders. Your accountant needs to understand transfer pricing, international tax treaties, and compliance requirements in multiple countries.

**Venture accounting expertise:** Revenue recognition, equity compensation, and investor reporting work differently for startups than traditional businesses. Make sure they understand the differences.

**Scalable systems:** You want an accountant who can grow with you from pre-revenue to Series A without requiring a complete system overhaul. Ask about their technology stack and reporting capabilities.

**Monthly financial packages:** Good startup accountants provide monthly financial statements, cash flow forecasts, and board-ready financial packages. This should be standard service, not an expensive add-on.

## Red Flags to Avoid

**"We've never seen that before":** If they're unfamiliar with common startup structures or documents, they're not the right fit for a venture-backed company.

**Resistance to international structures:** Some local practitioners are uncomfortable with Delaware holding companies or cross-border arrangements. This limits your future options.

**No technology platform:** Accountants still using desktop software or emailing Excel files aren't equipped for modern startup needs. Look for cloud-based systems with real-time reporting.

**Hourly billing for everything:** While some complex work requires hourly billing, routine startup services should be available on fixed-fee basis.

## How to Find Them

**Ask other founders:** The best referrals come from founders who've recently raised money or expanded internationally. Join local startup communities and ask for specific recommendations.

**Check with international VCs:** Venture capital firms often maintain lists of recommended service providers in markets where they invest. Even if you're not raising from them, their portfolio companies need the same services you do.

**Look for startup ecosystem involvement:** Lawyers and accountants who speak at startup events, write about venture law, or mentor in accelerators usually understand startup needs better than purely traditional practices.

**International firm local offices:** Global firms like Baker McKenzie or PwC often have startup-focused teams in their MENA offices, combining international expertise with local market knowledge.

The goal isn't to find the cheapest optionâ€”it's to find professionals who understand your business model and can scale with your growth. Good lawyers and accountants become strategic advisors, not just service providers.
