Most founders overcomplicate their early infrastructure. You don't need sophisticated legal structures, multiple bank accounts, or comprehensive insurance policies when you're still figuring out what to build. Here's what you actually need to get started.

## Company Structure: Keep It Simple

**Incorporate locally first.** Despite what you read about Delaware corporations and international structures, start with a simple local entity in whatever country you're based in. You can restructure later when you raise money.

**Use standard incorporation services.** Don't hire expensive lawyers to set up your initial company. Most MENA countries have online incorporation services or standard legal firms that handle basic company formation for a few hundred dollars.

**Don't optimize for future fundraising yet.** Complex holding structures, option pools, and investor-ready documents are premature optimization. Focus on having a legal entity that can sign contracts and receive payments.

**The One-Month Rule**
If you can't set up your basic company structure within one month and under $1,000, you're overcomplicating it. Simple incorporation should be fast and cheap.

## Banking: One Account Is Enough

**Open one business bank account.** You need to separate personal and business finances, but you don't need multiple accounts, multi-currency optimization, or sophisticated cash management. Pick a bank that's convenient and has reasonable fees.

**Avoid banks that over-complicate onboarding.** If a bank requires extensive business plans, financial projections, or multiple in-person meetings just to open an account, find a different bank. Your time is better spent building your product.

**Don't worry about international banking yet.** You can handle international payments through services like Wise or Payoneer when you need them. Don't let banking complexity delay getting started.

## Accounting: Minimize Overhead

**Use simple accounting software.** QuickBooks, Xero, or similar cloud-based services. Don't try to build custom spreadsheets or use complex ERP systems designed for larger companies.

**Track revenue and expenses only.** You don't need detailed cost accounting, departmental budgets, or sophisticated financial reporting until you have substantial revenue and employees.

**Find a basic accountant when you need one.** When your business gets complicated enough that you're spending significant time on bookkeeping, hire someone. But most pre-revenue startups can handle their own basic accounting.

## Legal Documents: Avoid Premature Optimization

**Standard employment agreements only.** If you have co-founders or early employees, use standard employment agreement templates. Don't create complex equity structures or detailed intellectual property assignments until you're raising money.

**Basic terms of service and privacy policy.** If you have a website or app, you need these documents. Use standard templates from legal service websites rather than hiring lawyers to create custom versions.

**Don't worry about comprehensive IP protection.** Trademark and patent applications are expensive and time-consuming. Focus on building something people want before worrying about protecting it legally.

**The Revenue Test**
Before spending money on any professional service, ask: "Will this help me get my first paying customer faster?" If the answer is no, it can probably wait.

## What You Don't Need Yet

**Insurance beyond basic liability.** Professional liability, errors and omissions, cyber security insuranceâ€”these become important when you have significant revenue and employees. Don't let insurance brokers convince you to buy comprehensive coverage when you're pre-revenue.

**Sophisticated tax planning.** Worry about tax optimization when you have profits to optimize. Basic compliance is sufficient until you're generating substantial revenue.

**HR systems and employee handbooks.** If you have fewer than five employees, you don't need formal HR processes, detailed employee handbooks, or sophisticated benefit plans.

**International tax and legal structures.** Delaware holding companies, Singapore subsidiaries, and international tax optimization are fundraising-stage concerns, not startup-stage concerns.

## MENA-Specific Considerations

**Free zone incorporation.** Many MENA countries offer free zone incorporation with tax benefits and simplified processes. These can be good options, but don't let the decision paralyze you. Any legitimate business structure is better than no structure.

**Local language requirements.** Some jurisdictions require company documents in Arabic or local languages. Budget for translation services if necessary, but don't let this delay incorporation.

**Bank account opening requirements.** Different countries have different documentation requirements for business bank accounts. Research this early, but don't wait until you have perfect documentation to start the process.

**Regulatory compliance.** Some industries (fintech, healthcare, education) have specific licensing requirements. Understand these early, but don't let regulatory uncertainty prevent you from starting to build.

## Getting Started Checklist

**Week 1:**
- Choose a company name and check availability
