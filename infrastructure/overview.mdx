# Infrastructure Overview

*Building the tools that build everything else*

Infrastructure startups are having a moment. Developer tools, cloud platforms, and enterprise infrastructure are all experiencing unprecedented growth. The reason is simple: every company is becoming a software company, and they all need better tools.

Infrastructure is different from consumer or traditional B2B software. Your customers are technical. They evaluate products differently. They have higher switching costs but also higher standards.

## What Counts as Infrastructure

**Developer tools.** IDEs, testing frameworks, deployment tools, monitoring systems.

**Cloud platforms.** Computing, storage, databases, networking services.

**Enterprise infrastructure.** Identity management, security tools, compliance platforms.

**Data infrastructure.** Warehouses, pipelines, analytics platforms, ML operations.

The common thread: your product helps other companies build their products.

## Why Infrastructure Works Now

**Every company needs software.** Even traditional industries are digitizing. They all need tools to build and operate software.

**Complexity is increasing.** Modern applications use dozens of services. Managing this complexity creates opportunities.

**Security and compliance requirements are stricter.** Regulations like GDPR and SOX create demand for specialized tools.

**Remote work changed everything.** Teams need better collaboration and deployment tools.

## The Infrastructure Advantage

**Sticky customers.** Switching infrastructure is painful. Once you win a customer, they tend to stay.

**Predictable revenue.** Infrastructure spending is usually budgeted and recurring.

**Network effects.** Popular tools become more valuable as more developers use them.

**High switching costs.** The more integrated your tool becomes, the harder it is to replace.

## Infrastructure Customer Types

**Individual developers.** They discover and evaluate tools. Often the path to larger deals.

**Engineering teams.** They implement and advocate for tools within their companies.

**CTOs and VPs of Engineering.** They approve budgets and make final decisions.

**Procurement and security teams.** They create requirements and control access.

You need to satisfy all four groups, but they have different priorities.

## Common Infrastructure Mistakes

**Building for yourself only.** Just because you need a tool doesn't mean other developers do.

**Ignoring enterprise requirements.** Security, compliance, and procurement processes matter for big deals.

**Over-engineering from the start.** Infrastructure products can start simple and add complexity over time.

**Poor developer experience.** If developers don't love using your tool, it won't spread.

## The Infrastructure Playbook

**1. Start with developers.** Build something individual developers love using.

**2. Create viral adoption.** Make it easy for developers to share and recommend your tool.

**3. Add team features.** Once individuals adopt, teams want collaboration and management features.

**4. Enterprise-ify.** Add security, compliance, and administrative features for larger companies.

**5. Platform-ize.** Become a platform that other tools integrate with.

## Distribution Strategies

**Product-led growth.** Start with a free tier that developers can try without talking to sales.

**Community building.** Sponsor conferences, contribute to open source, create educational content.

**Partner channels.** Integrate with platforms your customers already use.

**Direct sales.** For enterprise deals, you'll eventually need a traditional sales process.

## Metrics That Matter

**Time to value.** How quickly can new users get value from your product?

**Feature adoption.** Are users discovering and using advanced features?

**Net revenue retention.** Are customers spending more over time?

**Developer satisfaction.** Happy developers become advocates.

## Getting Started

Pick a pain point you've experienced as a developer or operator. Build the tool you wish existed. Make it work perfectly for that one use case before expanding.

Infrastructure startups take longer to build but can be more defensible than application-layer companies. The key is patience and technical excellence.
