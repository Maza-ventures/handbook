# Ideas

*How to find startup ideas that don't suck*

The biggest lie in startup land is that ideas don't matter. Of course they matter. Bad ideas fail. Good ideas at least have a chance.

But here's what's true: most people are bad at recognizing good startup ideas. They either aim too high ("let's build the next Facebook") or too low ("an app for dog walkers but with blockchain").

Good startup ideas share a few characteristics that aren't obvious until you see them.

## What Makes a Good Startup Idea

**It solves a problem you have.** The best startup ideas come from founders who were users first. You understand the problem viscerally because you've lived it.

**The problem is getting worse.** Technology trends create new problems faster than old solutions can adapt. Email created spam. Mobile created attention fragmentation. AI is creating new problems right now.

**People are already hacking together solutions.** If people are using spreadsheets to manage something complex, there's probably a startup opportunity. If they're switching between five different tools to accomplish one workflow, there's definitely one.

**It starts narrow but can expand.** Facebook started as a directory for college students. Amazon started selling books. The best ideas look small but hide large markets underneath.

## Where to Look

**Your job.** What's the most annoying part of your current work? What would you pay to make go away? Your colleagues probably have the same problem.

**Recent technology shifts.** Every major platform shift creates new opportunities. Mobile created Uber and Instagram. Cloud created modern SaaS. AI is creating new categories right now.

**Regulation changes.** New laws create new problems. GDPR created opportunities for privacy tools. Financial regulations create fintech opportunities.

**Demographic shifts.** Aging populations, urbanization, remote work - demographic changes create new needs.

## Red Flags

**Solutions in search of problems.** "It's like Uber but for X" usually means you don't understand either Uber or X.

**Markets that don't exist yet.** "When people realize they need this..." usually means they don't need it.

**Ideas that require behavior change.** People don't change behavior easily. It's better to fit into existing behavior than to try to change it.

**"Wouldn't it be cool if..."** Cool rarely translates to useful. Useful sometimes becomes cool.

## The Idea Maze

Most founders think they need one great idea. Actually, you need to navigate what Balaji Srinivasan calls the "idea maze" - understanding all the paths through a problem space.

For any problem worth solving, there are multiple approaches:
- Different target customers
- Different business models  
- Different technical solutions
- Different go-to-market strategies

The founders who succeed aren't necessarily the ones with the best initial idea. They're the ones who understand the maze well enough to pivot when needed.

## Testing Ideas Quickly

**Talk to potential users.** Not about your solution - about their problems. People lie about solutions but tell the truth about problems.

**Look for existing solutions.** If no one else is trying to solve this problem, that's usually bad news, not good news.

**Check if people pay for partial solutions.** Are they hiring consultants? Using expensive enterprise software? Paying multiple vendors? Money flows toward problems.

**Build the smallest possible version.** Don't validate an idea by talking. Validate it by building something, even if it's just a landing page.

## Common Mistakes

**Falling in love with your first idea.** Your first idea is probably wrong. Get comfortable with this.

**Avoiding competition.** Competition usually means there's a real market. Zero competition usually means zero market.

**Starting with the business model.** Figure out the problem first. Business models are easier to change than problems.

**Overthinking uniqueness.** Most successful startups aren't doing something completely new. They're doing something familiar but better.

## The Meta-Skill

The real skill isn't having good ideas. It's getting better at recognizing them. This comes from:

- Talking to users constantly
- Understanding technology trends
- Knowing what's been tried before and why it failed
- Building things quickly to test assumptions

Good founders develop an intuition for what problems are worth solving. This intuition comes from experience, not inspiration.

Start with problems. Solutions follow.
