# Founders

*The people who build the thing*

Most startup advice focuses on the product or the market. But the most important factor in startup success is usually the founders. Great founders can pivot a mediocre idea into a great company. Bad founders can destroy even great ideas.

## What Makes a Good Founder

**Domain expertise.** The best founders deeply understand the problem they're solving, usually because they've lived it.

**Complementary skills.** If you're technical, find a business co-founder. If you're business-focused, find a technical co-founder. Jack-of-all-trades works for consulting, not startups.

**Obsessive about the problem.** You'll work on this for years. Make sure it's something you genuinely care about solving.

**Comfortable with uncertainty.** Startups are exercises in making decisions with incomplete information.

## The Co-founder Question

Should you have co-founders? Usually yes. Solo founders can succeed, but it's harder.

**Benefits of co-founders:**
- Complementary skills
- Shared workload and stress
- Better decision-making
- More credible to investors

**Risks of co-founders:**
- Equity disagreements
- Different commitment levels
- Communication overhead
- Relationship management

If you do have co-founders, treat the relationship like a marriage. Discuss expectations, commitment, and equity upfront.

## Co-founder Equity Splits

The default split for two co-founders is 50/50. For three, it's usually 40/30/30 or 50/25/25, depending on who's leading.

**Common equity mistakes:**
- Unequal splits without clear justification
- Not vesting equity over time
- Not discussing what happens if someone leaves
- Waiting too long to formalize the arrangement

Use vesting schedules (typically 4 years with a 1-year cliff) for all founders. This protects the company if someone leaves early.

## Finding Co-founders

**Best sources:**
- People you've worked with before
- Classmates from school or bootcamps
- Industry connections
- Technical communities and meetups

**Red flags:**
- They want equity but won't commit full-time
- They've never finished a significant project
- They talk more than they execute
- They're not enthusiastic about your specific idea

## The Founder-Market Fit

Just like product-market fit, there's founder-market fit. You need to be the right person to solve this particular problem.

**Questions to ask:**
- Why are you uniquely qualified to solve this problem?
- What insights do you have that others don't?
- What unfair advantages do you bring?
- Why now, and why you?

If you can't answer these convincingly, you might be solving the wrong problem.

## Common Founder Mistakes

**Not defining roles clearly.** Who makes final decisions? Who handles what responsibilities? Figure this out early.

**Hiring friends and family.** Personal relationships and business relationships are different. Mixing them usually ends badly.

**Not taking care of themselves.** Burnout doesn't make you more productive. Exercise, sleep, and take breaks.

**Trying to do everything.** Focus on what only founders can do. Delegate or delay everything else.

## The Founder Journey

**Months 1-6:** Validate the idea, build initial product, find co-founders if needed.

**Months 6-18:** Get to product-market fit, hire first employees, raise money if needed.

**Years 2-5:** Scale the product and team, expand market reach, optimize operations.

**Years 5+:** Decide whether to stay as CEO or hire professional management.

Most founders are good at starting companies but struggle with scaling them. This is normal. Know your strengths and hire accordingly.

## When to Quit

Sometimes the right decision is to stop. Consider quitting if:
- You're not passionate about the problem anymore
- The market isn't responding after 18+ months
- You and your co-founders fundamentally disagree
- The stress is affecting your health or relationships

Quitting isn't failure if you learn from it. Most successful founders have at least one failed startup behind them.

## The Meta-Skill

The most important founder skill is learning quickly. Everything else can be learned or hired.

Be curious, ask questions, admit what you don't know, and get better every day. That's how startups succeed.
