# Business Model

Your business model is how you create, deliver, and capture value. It's not just how you make money - it's the fundamental logic of how your business works.

Most founders focus on their product first and figure out the business model later. This is backwards. The best products are designed around sustainable business models from the beginning.

## Revenue Models

### One-Time Sales
**How it works:** Customers pay once for a product or service
**Best for:** Physical products, software licenses, professional services
**Advantages:** Simple to understand, immediate cash flow
**Disadvantages:** Need constant new customer acquisition, no recurring revenue

### Subscriptions
**How it works:** Customers pay regularly for ongoing access
**Best for:** Software, content, services with ongoing value
**Advantages:** Predictable revenue, high customer lifetime value
**Disadvantages:** Need to continuously deliver value, churn is expensive

### Usage-Based
**How it works:** Customers pay based on how much they use
**Best for:** APIs, cloud services, utilities
**Advantages:** Revenue scales with customer success, no usage limits
**Disadvantages:** Unpredictable revenue, complex pricing

### Marketplace/Commission
**How it works:** Take a percentage of transactions between buyers and sellers
**Best for:** Two-sided markets, platforms
**Advantages:** Revenue scales with transaction volume
**Disadvantages:** Need to balance both sides of the market

### Advertising
**How it works:** Provide free service, make money from advertisers
**Best for:** High-traffic consumer products
**Advantages:** Free for users, scales with audience size
**Disadvantages:** Need massive scale, user experience compromises

### Freemium
**How it works:** Free basic service, paid premium features
**Best for:** Software with clear usage tiers
**Advantages:** Low customer acquisition friction
**Disadvantages:** Most users never convert, expensive to serve free users

## Unit Economics

Unit economics is the math behind your business model. For each customer, how much does it cost to acquire them, how much revenue do they generate, and what's your profit margin?

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** How much you spend on sales and marketing to get one new customer.

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** How much revenue you expect from a customer over their entire relationship with your company.

**LTV/CAC ratio:** Your lifetime value should be at least 3x your acquisition cost. Higher is better, but too high might mean you're not investing enough in growth.

**Payback period:** How long it takes to recover your customer acquisition cost. Shorter is better for cash flow.

**Gross margin:** Revenue minus direct costs of delivering your product. This should be as high as possible.

If your unit economics don't work at small scale, they won't magically work at large scale. Fix the fundamentals before trying to grow.

## Pricing Strategy

Pricing is one of the most important and least understood aspects of business models. Most founders underprice their products.

**Cost-plus pricing:** Add a markup to your costs. Simple but ignores customer value.

**Value-based pricing:** Price based on the value you deliver to customers. Usually leads to higher prices and profits.

**Competitive pricing:** Price relative to competitors. Easy to understand but can lead to race to the bottom.

**Penetration pricing:** Start low to gain market share. Risky because it's hard to raise prices later.

**Premium pricing:** Charge more to signal quality. Works if you can deliver superior value.

**How to test pricing:**
- Start higher than you think
- Test different price points with different customer segments
- Monitor conversion rates and customer feedback
- Don't compete on price alone

Price changes are one of the fastest ways to improve your business. Small increases in price can dramatically improve profitability.

## Business Model Innovation

The most successful companies often create new business models, not just new products.

**Examples of business model innovation:**
- Netflix: From DVD rental to streaming subscription
- Uber: From taxi dispatch to ride-sharing platform
- Salesforce: From software licenses to SaaS subscriptions
- Amazon: From bookstore to marketplace to cloud services

**Common patterns:**
- **Unbundling:** Taking one big product and selling the pieces separately
- **Rebundling:** Combining previously separate products into one offering
- **Platform creation:** Connecting buyers and sellers instead of selling directly
- **Service-ization:** Turning products into ongoing services

Look for opportunities to change not just what you sell, but how you sell it.

## Scaling Your Business Model

Not all business models scale equally well. Some get better as you grow, others get harder to manage.

**Network effects:** Your product becomes more valuable as more people use it. The strongest business models have network effects.

**Economies of scale:** Your costs per unit decrease as you grow. Manufacturing, software development, and content creation often have economies of scale.

**Switching costs:** How hard is it for customers to leave? High switching costs improve retention and pricing power.

**Viral growth:** Do customers naturally refer new customers? Viral products can grow without paid marketing.

**Defensibility:** What prevents competitors from copying your business model? Patents, network effects, economies of scale, and brand are common moats.

## Multi-Sided Markets

Many of the most valuable companies operate multi-sided markets, connecting different groups of users.

**Examples:**
- Google: Connects searchers and advertisers
- Uber: Connects riders and drivers
- App stores: Connect developers and users
- Credit cards: Connect merchants and consumers

**Key challenges:**
- **Chicken and egg problem:** Need both sides to be valuable, but hard to get started
- **Balancing the sides:** Changes that help one side might hurt the other
- **Pricing:** Who pays? How much? Different structures affect behavior

**Success strategies:**
- Start with one side that has the most to gain
- Subsidize the side that's harder to get
- Create tools that are valuable even without the other side

## Subscription Business Models

Subscriptions are popular because they create predictable revenue, but they're harder to execute than they appear.

**Key metrics:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Customer churn rate
- Revenue churn rate
- Net revenue retention

**Common mistakes:**
- Underestimating churn
- Not investing enough in customer success
- Adding too many pricing tiers
- Not understanding usage patterns

**Success factors:**
- Deliver ongoing value, not just access
- Invest heavily in onboarding and customer success
- Make cancellation difficult (but not impossible)
- Continuously improve your product

## Business Model Pivots

Sometimes you need to change your business model, not just your product.

**Common pivot types:**
- **Customer segment:** Same product, different customers
- **Problem:** Same customers, different problem
- **Solution:** Same problem, different solution
- **Revenue model:** Same product, different way to make money

**When to pivot:**
- Unit economics don't work and can't be fixed
- Market is too small for your ambitions
- Competition makes your model unsustainable
- New opportunities emerge that are much larger

**How to pivot:**
- Test new models with existing customers first
- Communicate changes clearly to stakeholders
- Move quickly once you decide
- Learn from what didn't work

## Common Business Model Mistakes

**Solving a problem people won't pay for.** Some problems are real but not valuable enough to build a business around.

**Underpricing to get customers.** Low prices attract price-sensitive customers who are likely to leave for cheaper alternatives.

**Too many revenue streams.** Focus on one primary way to make money before adding others.

**Ignoring customer acquisition costs.** If it costs more to acquire customers than they're worth, you don't have a business.

**Not understanding your value proposition.** If you can't clearly explain why customers should pay you, they won't.

**Copying someone else's business model.** What works for one company might not work for another.

## Building Sustainable Businesses

**Focus on profitability:** Revenue is nice, but profit is what sustains businesses long-term.

**Understand your cash conversion cycle:** How long between when you spend money and when you collect revenue?

**Build recurring relationships:** One-time customers are expensive. Repeat customers are profitable.

**Create multiple revenue streams:** But only after you've mastered one.

**Invest in customer retention:** It's much cheaper to keep existing customers than acquire new ones.

**Monitor unit economics obsessively:** Small changes in acquisition cost or lifetime value can make or break your business.

The best business models create value for customers while capturing enough of that value to sustain and grow the business. They align customer success with company success, creating virtuous cycles that compound over time.

Your business model will evolve as you learn more about your customers and market. Start with something simple that works, then optimize and innovate from there. The goal is not to have the most creative business model - it's to have a business model that creates sustainable value for everyone involved.
