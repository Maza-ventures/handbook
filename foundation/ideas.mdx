# Ideas

The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.

The very best startup ideas have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.

## Why Most Ideas Are Bad

Most people's first startup idea is bad. That's normal. The problem is they often persist with the bad idea instead of moving on to better ones.

Bad ideas have a quality that makes them particularly dangerous: they sound good. That's why people get stuck on them. A truly bad idea sounds obviously bad from the outset.

The ideas that sound good but are actually bad tend to be:

**Solving a problem that doesn't exist.** You think this would be cool, but no one actually wants it. University students often make this mistake because they haven't yet encountered real problems in the business world.

**Solving a problem that exists but that people are willing to live with.** There are many problems that seem like they need to be solved, but when you think about it, people have learned to work around them or just accept them.

**Solving a problem that requires convincing people to change their behavior.** Getting people to change how they do things is extraordinarily difficult, even when your solution is better.

## How to Get Good Ideas

Good startup ideas come from noticing problems in your daily life. The best ideas seem obvious in retrospect, but they're not obvious to most people at the time.

**Live in the future.** If you're not at the leading edge of a field, you're missing ideas right in front of you. The most valuable insights come from being immersed in a domain where change is happening.

**Work on interesting things.** If you work on boring things, you'll find boring problems. If you work at the forefront of technology, you'll naturally encounter problems worth solving.

**Talk to potential users constantly.** Some problems only become visible when you understand people's workflows intimately. The best ideas often come from understanding specific pain points that outsiders would never notice.

**Notice what you wish existed.** Pay attention when you find yourself thinking "someone should make..." These thoughts are often startup ideas in disguise.

## Evaluating Ideas

Once you have an idea, you need to figure out if it's worth pursuing. Here are the questions that matter:

**Is this a problem people are willing to pay to solve?** Not all problems are worth paying for. Some are just minor annoyances. Others people have already found free solutions for.

**Can you build a simple version quickly?** If your idea requires a massive upfront investment to test, it's probably too ambitious for a startup. The best ideas let you start small and learn fast.

**Do you have an unfair advantage?** Why will you succeed where others have failed or never tried? This could be domain expertise, unique insights, or simply caring more about the problem.

**Is the timing right?** Some ideas are good but premature. Others are good but too late. The best startup ideas happen when the necessary technology has just become possible.

## Common Mistakes

**Following trends.** By the time something is obviously trendy, it's probably too late. The best opportunities exist just before they become obvious to everyone.

**Trying to think of ideas.** Sitting in a room brainstorming startup ideas rarely works. The best ideas come from living your life and noticing problems organically.

**Starting with the solution.** Don't start with "let's build an app" or "let's use AI." Start with a real problem and work toward the simplest solution.

**Ignoring competitors.** If no one else is working on your idea, that's usually a bad sign, not a good one. Some competition validates that there's a real market.

**Making it too complicated.** The best startup ideas can be explained in one sentence. If you need a long explanation, your idea probably isn't focused enough.

## The Schlep Blindness Problem

Many potentially great startup ideas are ignored because they seem like too much work. This is called "schlep blindness" - the inability to see opportunities that involve a lot of tedious, unglamorous work.

Most people naturally filter out ideas that seem like a slog. But that's exactly what makes them good startup opportunities. If something seems hard and boring to most people, there's less competition.

The most successful startups often involve doing things that don't scale at first. If you're willing to do the tedious work that others won't, you can build something valuable.

## How Ideas Evolve

The best startup ideas often start as something else. Twitter started as a podcasting platform. Instagram was originally a location-based check-in app. What matters is starting somewhere and being willing to pivot when you learn something new.

Don't get too attached to your initial idea. What matters is finding a problem worth solving, not executing your original plan perfectly.

The goal isn't to have the perfect idea from day one. It's to start with something promising and let it evolve as you learn more about your users and their problems.

Most successful startups end up doing something different from what they started with. What stayed the same was the founders' commitment to solving a real problem for real people.
