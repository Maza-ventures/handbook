# Team

The most important decision you'll make is who you start a company with. Get this wrong and nothing else matters. Get it right and you can survive almost any other mistake.

Most startup advice focuses on products and markets. But the most important factor in startup success is usually the people. Great founders can turn a mediocre idea into a great company. Bad founders will destroy even the best ideas.

## Solo vs Co-founders

Should you have co-founders? Usually yes, but not always.

**The case for co-founders:**
- Shared workload and emotional burden
- Complementary skills and knowledge
- Better decision-making through discussion
- More credible to investors and employees
- Someone to keep you going when things get tough

**The case against co-founders:**
- Equity splits and control issues
- Potential for conflict and disagreement
- Communication overhead
- Risk of co-founder leaving at critical moments

If you're naturally good at both the technical and business sides, you might be able to go it alone. But this is rare. Most successful solo founders eventually bring on co-founders or early employees who function like co-founders.

## What Makes a Good Co-founder

**Complementary skills.** If you're technical, find someone business-focused. If you're business-focused, find someone technical. Jack-of-all-trades works for consulting, not startups.

**Shared commitment.** Your co-founder needs to be as committed as you are. Part-time co-founders are worse than no co-founders. If they won't quit their job, they're not really a co-founder.

**Mutual respect.** You need to genuinely believe your co-founder is smart and capable. If you find yourself constantly questioning their judgment, the partnership won't work.

**Different but compatible working styles.** You don't need to be best friends, but you need to be able to work together effectively under stress.

**Honesty and trustworthiness.** You'll face difficult decisions together. If you can't trust your co-founder to be honest when it matters, everything else is irrelevant.

## Where to Find Co-founders

**People you've worked with before.** This is ideal because you already know how you work together. Past colleagues, classmates from group projects, or people you've built things with.

**Your existing network.** Friends, classmates, people from your industry. The best co-founder relationships often start with existing relationships.

**Professional communities.** Industry meetups, conferences, online communities. Look for people who are actively working on interesting problems in your domain.

**Accelerators and startup events.** These gather ambitious people in one place, but be careful. Co-founder dating is often artificial and rushed.

The worst place to find co-founders is at "co-founder dating" events. Real partnerships develop organically from working together or knowing each other already.

## Equity Splits

For two co-founders, 50/50 is usually right. Unequal splits need strong justification.

**Common equity mistakes:**
- Unequal splits based on who had the original idea (ideas aren't worth much)
- Not using vesting schedules (always vest over 4 years)
- Waiting too long to formalize the arrangement
- Not discussing what happens if someone leaves

Use vesting schedules for all founders. Typically 4 years with a 1-year cliff. This protects the company if someone leaves early and aligns incentives for the long term.

## The First Employees

Your first few employees are almost as important as your co-founders. They set the culture and work standards for everyone who comes after.

**Hire people better than you.** If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. Early employees should make you feel slightly insecure about your own abilities.

**Hire for potential, not just experience.** Early-stage companies can't afford senior people, and senior people often aren't suitable for startup environments anyway. Look for smart, driven people who can grow with the company.

**Cultural fit matters more than experience.** Skills can be learned. Culture is much harder to change once established. Your first ten employees largely determine what kind of company you'll become.

**Hire slowly, fire quickly.** Especially for early employees, a bad hire can kill the company. Take time to get to know people before hiring them. But once you realize someone isn't working out, act fast.

## MENA Team Building Considerations

**Local vs expatriate talent:** Expatriate workers often have international experience but require visa sponsorship and may lack cultural context. Local talent understands the market better but may have limited exposure to global best practices. Balance based on your specific needs and growth plans.

**Competing with traditional industries:** Oil, gas, banking, and government sectors offer high salaries and job security. To attract top talent, emphasize growth opportunities, equity participation, and the chance to build something meaningful. Flexible work arrangements and learning opportunities often matter as much as salary.

**Visa and employment regulations:** Each MENA country has different visa categories, employment laws, and hiring processes. UAE and Saudi have streamlined processes for tech workers, while other countries may be more complex. Budget for visa costs and processing time in your hiring plans.

**Cross-cultural team dynamics:** Teams spanning Arabic, English, and French speakers require thoughtful communication strategies. Religious observance, cultural holidays, and work-life balance expectations vary. Build inclusive practices that respect different backgrounds while maintaining high performance standards.

**Regional talent mobility:** Many skilled workers in MENA are open to relocating within the region for good opportunities. Consider candidates from across MENA, not just your immediate market, especially for specialized technical roles.

## Common Team Mistakes

**Hiring friends and family.** Personal relationships and business relationships are different things. Mixing them usually ends badly for both.

**Too many co-founders.** Two or three is usually optimal. More than three and decision-making becomes cumbersome.

**Unclear roles and responsibilities.** Who makes the final decision when co-founders disagree? Who handles what functions? Figure this out early, not during a crisis.

**Optimizing for credentials over ability.** A Stanford MBA isn't necessarily better than someone who's built successful products. Focus on what people can actually do.

**Not firing fast enough.** Keeping the wrong people hurts team morale and company culture. If someone clearly isn't working out, waiting won't make it better.

## Building Culture

Culture isn't something you write on the wall. It's how people actually behave when no one is watching.

**Set expectations early.** Your first few hires establish the norms for everyone else. If you accept mediocre work or attitude early on, that becomes your standard.

**Hire people who care about the mission.** Money motivates everyone, but the best early employees also care about what you're building and why it matters.

**Create systems that reinforce your values.** If you value transparency, share information openly. If you value quality, don't ship things you're not proud of.

**Model the behavior you want to see.** As a founder, everything you do gets amplified. Your team will copy your work habits, communication style, and standards.

The culture you build in the first year largely determines what kind of company you'll be in year five. Most cultural problems are much easier to prevent than to fix.

## When Things Go Wrong

Co-founder conflicts are one of the top reasons startups fail. When relationships break down, it's usually because of:

**Different levels of commitment.** One person is all-in while the other treats it like a side project.

**Disagreement about direction.** Fundamental disagreements about what the company should become.

**Personal conflicts.** Personality clashes, communication problems, or changes in personal circumstances.

**Equity and control disputes.** Arguments about who deserves what or who gets to make decisions.

The best defense against these problems is clear communication from the beginning. Have difficult conversations early, when the stakes are lower and emotions aren't running high.

If conflicts arise, address them directly rather than hoping they'll resolve themselves. Sometimes relationships can be repaired. Sometimes the best solution is for someone to leave. Either way, waiting usually makes things worse.

The most important thing to remember: building a company is hard enough with the right people. With the wrong people, it's nearly impossible.
