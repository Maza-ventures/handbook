# Legal

Most founders overthink the legal structure. Pick something reasonable, set it up properly, then focus on building something people want. You can always restructure later when you have a real business.

The legal framework is important, but it's not the most important thing in the early days. Don't spend months optimizing your corporate structure before you've talked to a single customer.

## Where to Incorporate

**If you're bootstrapping:** Incorporate where you're building the business. Local is simpler and cheaper.

**If you plan to raise venture capital:** Delaware (for US companies) or the startup-friendly jurisdiction in your country. VCs strongly prefer Delaware corporations.

**If you're unsure:** Start simple with your local jurisdiction. You can always change later.

Delaware gets recommended so often that people think it's magic. It's not. Delaware is better if you plan to raise VC or go public, but for most early-stage companies, the benefits don't outweigh the extra complexity and cost.

## MENA-Specific Incorporation Options

**Free Zones:** Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), Qatar Financial Centre (QFC), and others offer 100% foreign ownership, tax benefits, and simplified regulations. Good for fintech, tech services, and companies targeting regional or international markets.

**Mainland incorporation:** Required for certain business activities and government contracts. More complex but necessary for B2G opportunities and some regulated sectors.

**Offshore entities:** Places like RAK ICC or Jebel Ali offer privacy and tax benefits but limit business activities. Mainly useful for holding companies or international trading.

**Consider dual structure:** Many successful MENA startups incorporate both locally (for operations) and in Delaware or Singapore (for fundraising). This adds complexity but provides flexibility for different stakeholder needs.

## Corporate Structure

**C-Corporation vs LLC vs Partnership:** 

C-Corp is standard for venture-backed companies because it's what investors expect. LLCs are simpler for small businesses that plan to stay small. Partnerships are rare and usually not what you want.

If you're serious about building a large company, just start with a C-Corp. The tax implications are rarely as important as founders think, and the flexibility is worth it.

**Stock classes:** Start simple with common stock for founders and employees. You can add preferred stock classes when investors require them.

**Capitalization:** Most early-stage companies start with 10 million authorized shares. This gives you plenty of room for employee stock options and future investment rounds without having to amend your charter constantly.

## Equity Splits

**Founder equity:** Equal splits (50/50 or 33/33/33) are common and usually right. Unequal splits need strong justification based on different levels of contribution or commitment.

**Vesting schedules:** Always use vesting schedules for founder equity. Standard is 4 years with a 1-year cliff. This means you earn your equity over 4 years, but you don't get anything if you leave in the first year.

**Employee equity:** Reserve 15-20% of your equity for employee stock options. You'll need this to attract good people.

**Advisor equity:** 0.1% to 1% depending on how much they actually help. Most advisors aren't worth much equity.

## Common Mistakes

**Overcomplicating the structure.** Don't create complex holding company structures or multiple entities unless you have a specific, compelling reason.

**Not vesting founder equity.** This is the most expensive mistake you can make. If a founder leaves without vesting, they take their full equity with them.

**Giving away too much equity too early.** Be conservative with equity grants. You can always give more later, but you can't take it back.

**Informal agreements.** Handshake deals between co-founders always end badly. Get everything in writing, even with your best friend.

**Waiting too long to formalize.** Don't spend months operating informally. Set up the basic structure as soon as you decide to work together seriously.

## Intellectual Property

**Assign all IP to the company.** Make sure all founders and employees assign their work product to the company. This includes code, designs, business plans, and anything else they create for the business.

**Non-compete agreements.** These are generally not enforceable for employees, but they can still be useful for founders and key employees. Don't make them overly broad or they won't hold up in court.

**Trademarks and domains.** Register your domain name and consider trademarking your company name if it's distinctive. Don't worry about patents unless you're in a patent-heavy industry.

**Open source considerations.** If you're building software, be careful about which open source licenses you use. Some licenses can affect your ability to keep your own code proprietary.

## Contracts and Agreements

**Customer contracts.** Start with simple terms of service for your product. You can get more sophisticated as you grow and understand your business better.

**Vendor agreements.** Read the contracts with your key suppliers and service providers. Pay special attention to liability, termination clauses, and data handling.

**Employee agreements.** Every employee should sign an agreement covering confidentiality, IP assignment, and any non-compete or non-solicitation terms.

**Founder agreements.** Document the equity split, roles and responsibilities, decision-making process, and what happens if someone leaves.

## Regulatory Considerations

Most startups don't need to worry about heavy regulation, but some industries have specific requirements:

**Financial services:** Banking, lending, and payment processing are heavily regulated. Make sure you understand what licenses you need.

**Healthcare:** Medical devices and health data have strict regulatory requirements. Factor compliance costs into your business plan.

**Data privacy:** If you handle personal data, especially in Europe, make sure you understand GDPR and similar privacy regulations.

**Professional services:** Some services require professional licenses or certifications.

## MENA-Specific Regulatory Factors

**Islamic finance compliance:** If targeting Islamic markets or investors, understand Sharia-compliant business structures. This affects interest-based revenue models, debt financing, and certain business activities.

**Government sector requirements:** B2G opportunities often require local partnerships, specific certifications, or minimum local ownership percentages. Plan for this early if government contracts are part of your strategy.

**Cross-border restrictions:** Some MENA countries have restrictions on cross-border payments, data storage, or foreign exchange. Understand these limitations before committing to a regional expansion strategy.

**Sector-specific regulations:** Industries like telecommunications, media, and logistics often require local partnerships or have foreign ownership limits. Research your industry's specific requirements in target markets.

## When to Hire Lawyers

**Incorporation:** You can do this yourself with online services, but a lawyer ensures everything is set up correctly from the start.

**First funding round:** Definitely use a lawyer for any institutional investment. The documents are too complex and important to handle yourself.

**Complex agreements:** Any contract that's strategically important or legally complex should be reviewed by a lawyer.

**Regulatory issues:** If you're in a regulated industry, get specialized legal help early.

**Employment issues:** Firing employees, especially co-founders, usually requires legal advice.

Don't use lawyers for routine tasks you can handle yourself, but don't be cheap when legal issues could sink your company.

## Cap Tables and Record Keeping

**Maintain accurate records.** Your cap table (who owns what percentage of the company) is one of your most important documents. Keep it updated and accurate.

**Board resolutions.** Document important company decisions with formal board resolutions, especially equity grants, major contracts, and strategic decisions.

**Stock ledger.** Keep track of all stock issuances, transfers, and option grants. This becomes critical during fundraising or exit.

**Annual filings.** Don't forget to file your annual reports and pay your franchise taxes. Missing these can cause serious problems later.

## Taxes

**Business taxes:** Corporations pay taxes on profits. Pass-through entities (LLCs, S-Corps) pass profits and losses to the owners.

**Payroll taxes:** If you have employees, you need to handle payroll taxes correctly. Use a payroll service like Gusto or ADP.

**Sales tax:** If you sell physical products or services, you may need to collect sales tax in multiple states.

**International considerations:** If you have customers, employees, or operations in multiple countries, tax compliance gets complicated quickly.

Get an accountant early, especially if you're dealing with payroll or complex tax situations. The cost is worth avoiding the headaches and potential penalties.

## Changing Structure Later

Don't worry too much about getting everything perfect initially. Most successful companies end up restructuring at some point:

**Reincorporation:** You can move from one state or country to another, though it involves some cost and complexity.

**Entity conversion:** LLCs can convert to corporations, partnerships can become corporations, etc.

**International expansion:** You may need to set up subsidiaries in other countries as you grow.

The key is starting with something reasonable and not letting perfect be the enemy of good. The best legal structure is the one that lets you focus on building your business instead of managing legal complexity.
