# SaaS Overview

*Software as a Service: The most forgiving startup model*

SaaS is probably the best type of startup for first-time founders. The economics are predictable, the technology is well-understood, and the playbook is proven. You can bootstrap or raise venture capital. You can sell to consumers or enterprises. You can start simple and add complexity over time.

But "forgiving" doesn't mean "easy." SaaS companies fail for predictable reasons, usually around product-market fit or unit economics.

## Why SaaS Works

**Recurring revenue.** Once you acquire a customer, they keep paying you every month. This makes growth compounding rather than linear.

**Software margins.** After you build the product, serving additional customers costs almost nothing. Most SaaS companies achieve 80%+ gross margins.

**Predictable metrics.** SaaS has well-established metrics (MRR, churn, CAC, LTV) that make it easier to diagnose problems and track progress.

**Network effects aren't required.** Unlike social networks or marketplaces, SaaS products can succeed without network effects. Each customer gets value independently.

## The SaaS Playbook

**1. Find a workflow problem.** The best SaaS products replace spreadsheets, email chains, or manual processes with purpose-built software.

**2. Start with a narrow use case.** Don't try to build an all-in-one platform from day one. Pick one specific job and do it exceptionally well.

**3. Get to product-market fit.** You'll know you have it when customers start asking for features faster than you can build them.

**4. Optimize the funnel.** Once you have product-market fit, focus on converting more prospects into paying customers.

**5. Expand within accounts.** It's much cheaper to grow revenue from existing customers than to acquire new ones.

## Common SaaS Mistakes

**Building a vitamin, not a painkiller.** Nice-to-have features don't generate recurring revenue. Must-have workflows do.

**Pricing too low.** Most first-time SaaS founders under-price their products. If customers aren't complaining about price, you're probably charging too little.

**Ignoring churn.** Growing MRR means nothing if your churn rate is high. Focus on retention before acquisition.

**Feature creep.** Adding features feels like progress but often just confuses users. Stay focused on your core value proposition.

## SaaS Unit Economics

The fundamental SaaS equation: **LTV > CAC**

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** = Average Revenue Per User / Churn Rate

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** = Total acquisition spend / Number of new customers

You need LTV to be at least 3x CAC for venture-scale businesses, higher for bootstrapped companies.

## Market Timing for SaaS

SaaS works in markets where:
- Manual processes are becoming too expensive or error-prone
- Regulations require better tracking and compliance
- Remote work creates new collaboration needs
- Industry-specific workflows aren't well-served by generic tools

## Getting Started

**Week 1:** Pick a specific workflow you understand well
**Week 2:** Build a basic version that solves the core problem
**Week 3:** Get 10 people to try it and give feedback
**Month 2:** Get your first paying customer
**Month 6:** $10k MRR or pivot

The beautiful thing about SaaS is that the path is well-worn. Follow it.
