# Metrics

If you're not measuring your business, you're flying blind. But measuring the wrong things is worse than measuring nothing at all. Most founders track vanity metrics that make them feel good but don't help them make better decisions.

The purpose of metrics is not to impress investors or boost your ego. It's to understand how your business works so you can improve it.

## What to Measure

**Measure the inputs that drive the outputs you care about.** Revenue is an output. The number of sales calls, conversion rates, and average deal size are inputs that drive revenue.

**Measure leading indicators, not just lagging indicators.** Traffic is a leading indicator of sales. Sales is a lagging indicator of business success.

**Measure things you can control.** You can't control how many visitors your website gets, but you can control how many sales calls you make.

**Measure the customer journey.** How do people find you? What makes them sign up? What makes them stick around? What makes them pay more?

**Measure retention as much as acquisition.** Getting new customers is expensive. Keeping existing customers is cheap. Track both.

## Key Metrics by Business Type

**SaaS/Subscription businesses:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Monthly churn rate
- Net Revenue Retention

**E-commerce:**
- Conversion rate
- Average order value
- Customer acquisition cost
- Customer lifetime value
- Repeat purchase rate

**Marketplaces:**
- Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
- Take rate (percentage of GMV you keep)
- Liquidity (supply and demand balance)
- Network effects metrics

**Enterprise software:**
- Sales cycle length
- Deal size
- Win rate
- Expansion revenue
- Net Promoter Score

The specific metrics matter less than understanding the unit economics of your business. How much does it cost to acquire a customer? How much revenue do they generate? How long do they stick around?

## Vanity Metrics vs Actionable Metrics

**Vanity metrics** make you feel good but don't help you make decisions:
- Page views
- Downloads
- Registered users
- Social media followers

**Actionable metrics** help you understand and improve your business:
- Active users
- Paying customers
- Revenue per customer
- Conversion rates
- Retention rates

Focus on metrics that, when they change, tell you something meaningful about your business and suggest actions you should take.

## Cohort Analysis

Cohort analysis groups customers by when they first used your product, then tracks their behavior over time. This is one of the most powerful analytical tools for understanding your business.

**User cohorts:** Group users by the month they first signed up. Track how many are still active after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, etc.

**Revenue cohorts:** Group customers by when they first paid. Track how much revenue each cohort generates over time.

**Feature cohorts:** Group users by which features they used first. See how this affects their long-term engagement.

Cohort analysis reveals trends that aggregate metrics hide. Your overall user count might be growing while your retention is actually getting worse.

## The North Star Metric

Your North Star metric is the single number that best captures the value your product delivers to customers. It aligns your team around what matters most.

**Good North Star metrics:**
- Active users (for social products)
- Revenue (for most businesses)
- Successful outcomes (for productivity tools)

**Bad North Star metrics:**
- Registered users (doesn't measure value delivered)
- Page views (doesn't measure value delivered)
- Downloads (doesn't measure ongoing value)

Your North Star should be something that, if it goes up, means your business is healthier and your customers are happier.

## Setting Up Analytics

**Start simple.** Don't try to track everything from day one. Start with the basics and add complexity as you learn what matters.

**Focus on events, not just page views.** Track what users actually do in your product: sign up, complete tasks, make purchases, invite friends.

**Set up conversion funnels.** Identify the key steps in your customer journey and measure how many people make it through each step.

**Use cohorts to understand retention.** How many users come back after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month?

**Track business metrics, not just product metrics.** Revenue, costs, profitability, cash flow.

## Common Metrics Mistakes

**Tracking too many metrics.** Focus on 3-5 key metrics rather than trying to track everything. Too many metrics leads to analysis paralysis.

**Optimizing for the wrong metrics.** Make sure your metrics actually correlate with business success. Optimizing for page views doesn't help if those visitors don't convert.

**Not segmenting your data.** Aggregate numbers hide important patterns. Segment by customer type, acquisition channel, feature usage, etc.

**Ignoring statistical significance.** Small changes in metrics might just be noise. Make sure you have enough data to draw meaningful conclusions.

**Measuring but not acting.** Data is only valuable if you use it to make decisions. Don't become a data collector - become a data-driven decision maker.

## Using Metrics to Make Decisions

**Identify your biggest constraint.** What's the bottleneck in your business? Is it getting traffic, converting visitors, retaining customers, or expanding accounts?

**Test hypotheses systematically.** Use your metrics to identify problems, form hypotheses about solutions, test those solutions, and measure the results.

**Look for patterns and trends.** Is retention improving or getting worse? Are certain customer segments more valuable than others? What acquisition channels work best?

**Set targets and track progress.** Goals without measurement are just wishes. Set specific, measurable targets and track your progress toward them.

**Review metrics regularly but not obsessively.** Check your key metrics weekly or monthly, not daily. Daily fluctuations are usually just noise.

## Building a Metrics Culture

**Make metrics visible.** Put key metrics on dashboards that everyone can see. Transparency keeps everyone focused on what matters.

**Teach people what metrics mean.** Don't just show numbers - help people understand what drives those numbers and how their work affects them.

**Celebrate improvements, not just achievements.** Recognition for moving metrics in the right direction, not just hitting arbitrary targets.

**Use metrics to guide hiring and priorities.** When metrics show problems, allocate resources to fix them. When metrics show opportunities, invest in them.

**Stay close to the underlying reality.** Numbers can be misleading. Talk to customers regularly to make sure your metrics reflect their actual experience.

## Advanced Analytics

As your business grows, you might need more sophisticated analytics:

**Predictive analytics:** Use historical data to predict future outcomes. Which customers are likely to churn? Which leads are most likely to convert?

**Attribution modeling:** Understand which marketing channels and touchpoints contribute to conversions. This gets complex when customers interact with multiple channels.

**A/B testing:** Systematically test changes to your product or marketing to see what works better. Essential for optimization.

**Machine learning:** Use algorithms to find patterns in your data that might not be obvious to humans. Useful for large datasets.

But remember: sophisticated analytics only help if you have good data and clear questions. Don't add complexity until you've mastered the basics.

## Reporting and Communication

**Create regular reports.** Weekly business reviews, monthly board reports, quarterly planning sessions. Regular reporting keeps everyone aligned.

**Tell stories with data.** Don't just show numbers - explain what they mean and what actions you're taking as a result.

**Focus on trends, not just snapshots.** Is the business getting better or worse? Are you making progress toward your goals?

**Be honest about bad news.** Don't hide problems or spin negative metrics. Address issues head-on and explain your plan to fix them.

**Use visuals effectively.** Charts and graphs can make complex data easier to understand, but don't overdo it. Simple tables are often better than fancy visualizations.

The goal of metrics isn't to have perfect information about your business - it's to have enough information to make good decisions and improve over time. Start with the basics, measure consistently, and use what you learn to build a better business.
