# Customers

Getting your first customers is completely different from getting your thousandth customer. Most founders try to use growth tactics before they understand who their customers are and why they buy.

The most important thing in the early days is not getting lots of customers. It's getting the right customers and understanding them deeply.

## Your First Customers

Your first ten customers are more important than your next thousand. They'll teach you what you're actually building and who it's really for.

**Start with people you know.** Friends, former colleagues, people in your network. Not because they'll give you money out of friendship, but because they'll give you honest feedback.

**Look for customers with urgent problems.** People who desperately need what you're building will forgive an imperfect product. People who might find it useful someday won't.

**Choose customers who can influence others.** Early customers who talk about your product are worth more than early customers who don't.

**Don't worry about scalable acquisition yet.** Do things that don't scale to get your first customers. Personal outreach, manual onboarding, custom implementations - whatever it takes to understand what you're building.

The goal with early customers is learning, not revenue. Pick customers who will help you learn fast, even if they're not your ideal long-term customers.

## Customer Development

Customer development is the ongoing process of understanding your customers' problems, behavior, and needs. It never stops.

**Talk to customers before you build.** Understand their current process, their pain points, and what they wish existed.

**Talk to customers while you build.** Show them prototypes, get feedback on design decisions, understand what's working and what isn't.

**Talk to customers after they start using your product.** How is their experience? What problems remain unsolved? What would make them recommend you to others?

**The goal isn't validation.** It's understanding. You're not trying to prove your idea is good - you're trying to learn what to build.

Most founders do customer development wrong. They ask leading questions designed to confirm their assumptions rather than open-ended questions designed to uncover truth.

## Finding Customers

**Go where your customers are.** If you're building for developers, hang out in developer communities. If you're building for small business owners, find where they congregate.

**Start with the problem, not the solution.** Look for people who have the problem you solve, not people who might want your specific solution.

**Use your network.** The easiest customers to reach are the ones you can get introduced to through people you know.

**Be helpful first.** Don't lead with your product. Lead with understanding their problems and providing value however you can.

**Personal outreach works better than mass marketing.** Especially early on, one thoughtful email beats a hundred generic ones.

The best early customer acquisition strategy is usually founder-led sales. No one understands your product better than you do, and no one cares more about solving customer problems.

## Customer Segments

Not all customers are equally valuable. Some will love your product, pay happily, and tell their friends. Others will complain constantly and demand endless customization.

**Identify your best customers.** Who gets the most value from your product? Who pays without complaining? Who refers other customers?

**Understand what makes them different.** What characteristics do your best customers share? Industry, company size, role, behavior patterns?

**Focus on attracting more customers like your best ones.** Don't try to serve everyone. Double down on the segments where you create the most value.

**Fire bad customers.** Customers who don't fit your product will drain your resources and distract you from serving customers who do fit.

The Pareto principle applies to customers: 20% of your customers will generate 80% of your value. Focus on that 20%.

## Pricing

Pricing is product positioning made concrete. How you price tells customers what you think your product is worth and who it's for.

**Start higher than you think.** Most founders underprice their products. It's easier to lower prices than to raise them.

**Price on value, not cost.** What's your product worth to customers? How much does it save them or help them make? Price based on that value.

**Use pricing to segment customers.** Different customer types are willing to pay different amounts. Use multiple tiers to capture value from different segments.

**Don't compete on price alone.** If price is your only advantage, you don't have a sustainable business. Focus on delivering unique value.

**Test pricing with real customers.** The only way to know if your pricing is right is to see if people actually pay it.

Pricing is one of the fastest ways to increase revenue. Small changes in price can have massive effects on your business.

## Sales Process

Most founders hate selling because they think of it as convincing people to buy something they don't want. Good selling is the opposite - it's helping people solve problems they already have.

**Understand before you pitch.** What problems does this customer have? How are they currently solving them? What would a better solution look like to them?

**Lead with questions, not features.** "What's your biggest challenge with X?" is better than "Our product does Y."

**Focus on outcomes, not features.** Customers don't care what your product does - they care what it does for them.

**Handle objections by understanding them.** When someone says "it's too expensive," they usually mean "I don't see enough value." Address the underlying concern.

**Follow up consistently.** Most sales happen after multiple touchpoints. Don't give up after one conversation.

The best salespeople are genuinely helpful. They solve customer problems, and sometimes that means recommending your product.

## Customer Success

Getting customers is expensive. Keeping them is cheap. Focus more energy on keeping the customers you have than constantly acquiring new ones.

**Onboard customers properly.** The first experience customers have with your product largely determines whether they'll stick around.

**Monitor usage patterns.** Customers who don't use your product regularly are at risk of churning. Reach out proactively to help them get value.

**Solve problems quickly.** When customers have issues, fix them fast. How you handle problems often matters more than whether problems occur.

**Ask for feedback regularly.** Don't wait for customers to complain. Actively seek feedback on how to improve their experience.

**Help customers succeed.** Your success depends on your customers' success. The more value they get from your product, the longer they'll stick around.

Happy customers are your best marketing channel. They'll refer new customers, provide testimonials, and forgive occasional problems.

## Customer Research

Understanding your customers is an ongoing process, not a one-time project.

**Quantitative research** tells you what's happening. Analytics, usage data, conversion rates, churn rates.

**Qualitative research** tells you why it's happening. Customer interviews, surveys, support conversations.

**Both are important.** Quantitative data shows you patterns. Qualitative data helps you understand what those patterns mean.

**Talk to churned customers.** People who stopped using your product can tell you what's missing or what went wrong.

**Talk to potential customers who didn't buy.** Understanding why people don't buy is as important as understanding why they do.

The goal is to understand your customers so well that you can predict what they'll want before they know it themselves.

## Common Customer Mistakes

**Trying to serve everyone.** Products that try to appeal to everyone usually appeal to no one.

**Not talking to customers enough.** You can't understand your customers from inside your office. Get out and talk to them regularly.

**Listening only to the loudest customers.** The customers who complain the most aren't necessarily representative of your broader customer base.

**Optimizing for quantity over quality.** A few customers who love your product are better than many customers who are indifferent.

**Not firing bad customers.** Some customers are more trouble than they're worth. It's okay to let them go.

**Competing on price alone.** If price is your only differentiator, you're in a race to the bottom.

## Building Customer Relationships

**Be responsive.** When customers reach out, respond quickly. This shows you care about their success.

**Be transparent.** If something goes wrong, tell customers what happened and what you're doing to fix it.

**Be helpful.** Sometimes the best way to help a customer isn't selling them your product - it's solving their problem however you can.

**Be consistent.** Customers should have the same positive experience every time they interact with your company.

**Be human.** People buy from people, not companies. Let your personality and values show through in your customer interactions.

The strongest businesses are built on strong customer relationships. Everything else - product features, marketing tactics, growth hacks - is secondary to genuinely caring about your customers and helping them succeed.
