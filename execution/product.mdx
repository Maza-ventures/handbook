# Product

Building products is not about building features. It's about solving problems. Most founders get trapped building things no one wants because they fall in love with their solution instead of staying focused on the problem.

The goal isn't to build the product you envision. It's to build the product your customers actually need.

## Start Small

The biggest mistake founders make is trying to build too much at once. They want to solve every possible problem and serve every possible customer from day one. This always fails.

**Build the minimum viable product (MVP).** Not the minimum marketable product or the minimum delightful product. The minimum thing that lets you start learning from real users.

Your MVP should be almost embarrassingly simple. If you're not a little embarrassed by your first release, you waited too long to ship.

**Focus on one core problem.** Don't try to be everything to everyone. Find one problem that people care about deeply and solve it better than anyone else.

**Choose one customer segment.** You can expand later. It's much easier to make one group love you than to make everyone like you.

The companies that win start by dominating a small market, then expand from there. Google started with search. Facebook started with college students. Amazon started with books.

## The Build-Measure-Learn Loop

Building a product is really a series of experiments. You have hypotheses about what users want, you build something to test those hypotheses, you measure the results, and you learn what to build next.

**Build:** Create the smallest thing that tests your most important hypothesis.

**Measure:** Track what actually happens when real users encounter your product.

**Learn:** Figure out what the data tells you about your assumptions.

Most founders skip the measure and learn steps. They build something, ship it, and immediately start building the next thing without understanding what users actually thought of the first thing.

## Product-Market Fit

Product-market fit is the only thing that matters. Everything else - team, funding, business model - is secondary to building something people want.

You know you have product-market fit when:
- Users are actively seeking out your product
- Usage is growing organically without paid marketing
- Users get noticeably upset when your product is down
- You're having trouble keeping up with demand

You don't have product-market fit when:
- You have to convince people to try your product
- Users sign up but don't stick around
- Growth requires constant paid marketing
- You're not sure if people would miss your product if it disappeared

**Before product-market fit:** Focus entirely on building something people want. Everything else is a distraction.

**After product-market fit:** Focus on scaling what's working. Don't change the core product that people love.

Most startups die before finding product-market fit. The ones that survive usually go through several iterations before they find something that works.

## Feature Decisions

Every feature you add makes your product more complex. Complexity is the enemy of both usability and maintainability. Be extremely careful about what you choose to build.

**Say no to most feature requests.** Users will always ask for more features. Most of these requests are solving edge cases for a small number of users.

**Look for patterns in requests.** If many users ask for the same thing, it's worth considering. If only one user asks for something, it's probably not core to your product.

**Understand the real problem behind requests.** Users are good at identifying problems but bad at prescribing solutions. When someone asks for a feature, dig deeper to understand what they're really trying to accomplish.

**Prioritize features that benefit your core use case.** Every feature should make your product better at solving the main problem you set out to solve.

The best products are focused. They do one thing extremely well rather than many things adequately.

## Quality vs Speed

In the early stages, speed usually beats quality. But this doesn't mean shipping broken products.

**What to optimize for speed:**
- Feature development cycles
- Time from idea to user feedback
- Fixing critical bugs
- Adding must-have functionality

**What not to compromise on:**
- Core user experience
- Data security and privacy
- Basic reliability and performance
- Legal and regulatory compliance

**Technical debt is inevitable.** You'll make shortcuts to ship faster. That's fine, as long as you're conscious about it and fix the important issues before they become bigger problems.

**Perfect is the enemy of good.** Shipping something imperfect that solves a real problem is better than not shipping anything while you perfect your solution.

## User Feedback

Your users are your best source of product direction, but you have to listen carefully. What they say and what they mean are often different things.

**Watch what users do, not just what they say.** Usage data is more reliable than surveys. If users say they love a feature but never use it, trust the usage data.

**Talk to users regularly.** Not just when you're making big decisions. Regular conversations help you understand their evolving needs and catch problems early.

**Focus on your best users.** The users who get the most value from your product can tell you what makes it great and what would make it even better.

**Be careful about feedback from non-users.** People who don't use your product often have strong opinions about what you should build. These opinions are usually wrong.

The goal isn't to build what every user asks for. It's to understand your users well enough to build what they actually need.

## Common Product Mistakes

**Building features instead of solving problems.** Features are how you solve problems, not the goal itself.

**Adding features instead of improving existing ones.** Making your core functionality better is usually more valuable than adding new functionality.

**Trying to appeal to everyone.** Products that try to serve everyone usually serve no one well.

**Not talking to users enough.** You can't build a great product from inside your office. You need constant contact with the people who use what you build.

**Ignoring usage data.** Your analytics tell you what's actually happening with your product. Pay attention to the patterns.

**Over-engineering the first version.** You'll probably rebuild major parts of your product as you learn more. Don't over-invest in perfection early on.

## Product Evolution

Your product will change significantly from your initial vision. That's not failure - it's learning.

**Stay flexible about solutions, stubborn about problems.** The specific problem you're solving should remain consistent, but how you solve it will evolve.

**Don't get too attached to features.** If something isn't working, remove it. Complexity without value hurts your product.

**Expand thoughtfully.** Once you've nailed your core use case, you can consider adjacent problems or customer segments. But don't lose focus on what made you successful.

**Listen to the market.** Sometimes users find value in your product that you didn't expect. Don't fight this - lean into what's working.

The best products evolve continuously based on user feedback and market changes. The worst products stick rigidly to their original plan regardless of what they learn.

## Building for Scale

You don't need to build for massive scale from day one, but you should avoid decisions that make scaling impossible later.

**Choose boring technology.** Use proven tools and frameworks. Save the cutting-edge technology for problems that actually require it.

**Design for your current scale, not your imagined future scale.** Over-engineering is expensive and usually wrong about what you'll actually need.

**But avoid decisions that lock you into a corner.** Some architectural choices are expensive to change later. Think carefully about these foundational decisions.

**Optimize for learning speed early, performance later.** In the beginning, the ability to change quickly is more valuable than perfect performance.

Most scaling problems are good problems to have. Focus on building something people want first, then worry about handling the success.
