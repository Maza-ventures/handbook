# Operations

Operations is everything that happens to keep your business running. Most founders ignore operations until something breaks, but the companies that scale smoothly are the ones that build good operational systems early.

Operations isn't glamorous, but it's what separates companies that can execute from companies that just have good ideas.

## Systems vs Heroics

Early-stage startups run on founder heroics. Founders work around the clock, handle every customer problem personally, and make every important decision. This works when you're small, but it breaks when you try to scale.

**Heroic operations:** Everything depends on specific people working extremely hard to keep things running.

**System operations:** Processes and tools ensure things run smoothly regardless of who's working on them.

The goal is to gradually replace heroics with systems. Every time you find yourself doing something manually and repeatedly, ask whether you can systematize it.

**Document processes as you create them.** When you figure out how to do something well, write it down so others can do it the same way.

**Build checklists for important tasks.** Even simple processes benefit from checklists. They ensure consistency and catch mistakes.

**Create templates for common activities.** Customer emails, project plans, meeting agendas - templates save time and improve quality.

## Hiring and Team Building

Your first few hires determine what kind of company you become. They set standards for everyone who comes after.

**Hire slowly, fire quickly.** Take time to find the right people, but don't keep the wrong people hoping they'll improve.

**Hire for potential, not just experience.** Smart people who care about your mission can learn skills. Experience without motivation is worthless.

**Cultural fit matters more early on.** Skills can be taught. Values and work ethic are much harder to change.

**Give people ownership.** The best employees want to own problems and solve them, not just execute tasks.

**Hire people better than you at their specialty.** If you're not learning from your employees, you're probably not hiring the right people.

**Set clear expectations.** People can't succeed if they don't know what success looks like. Be explicit about responsibilities and standards.

## Delegation

Learning to delegate is one of the hardest transitions for founders. You went from doing everything to trusting others to do things that could kill your company.

**Start with low-risk tasks.** Don't delegate your most critical responsibilities first. Build trust gradually.

**Explain the outcome, not just the task.** People do better work when they understand why something matters and how it fits into the bigger picture.

**Give people autonomy within boundaries.** Set clear constraints and goals, then let people figure out how to achieve them.

**Check progress without micromanaging.** Regular check-ins are important, but don't hover over people's shoulders.

**Accept that things will be done differently.** Different doesn't necessarily mean wrong. Focus on outcomes, not methods.

**Train people to make decisions.** Don't just delegate tasks - delegate decision-making authority within appropriate limits.

## Communication

As your team grows, communication becomes more important and more difficult. Information that used to flow naturally becomes trapped in silos.

**Over-communicate important information.** Tell people things multiple times in multiple ways. Assume they didn't hear it the first time.

**Default to transparency.** Share more information than you think necessary. People make better decisions when they understand context.

**Create regular communication rhythms.** Weekly team meetings, monthly all-hands, quarterly planning sessions. Regular meetings prevent information hoarding.

**Use asynchronous communication effectively.** Not everything needs a meeting. Email, chat, and shared documents can be more efficient for many types of communication.

**Document decisions and reasoning.** When you make important decisions, write down what you decided and why. This helps people understand and remember.

**Encourage questions.** People should feel comfortable asking for clarification. Confusion is expensive.

## Finance and Accounting

You don't need complex financial systems early on, but you need accurate information about your business performance.

**Track cash flow religiously.** Know how much money you have, how much you're spending, and how long it will last.

**Separate business and personal finances.** Use dedicated business bank accounts and credit cards. This makes accounting and taxes much easier.

**Invoice promptly and follow up on payments.** Cash flow problems often come from slow collection, not lack of sales.

**Understand your unit economics.** How much does it cost to acquire a customer? How much revenue do they generate? How long do they stick around?

**Budget for growth.** As you grow, expenses often grow faster than revenue. Plan for this.

**Get professional help when you need it.** An accountant and lawyer are worth their fees. Don't try to handle complex financial or legal issues yourself.

## Legal and Compliance

Legal issues can kill companies. Don't ignore them, but don't let them paralyze you either.

**Keep good records.** Corporate resolutions, contracts, employee agreements, intellectual property assignments. Everything should be documented.

**Understand your industry's regulations.** Some businesses have specific compliance requirements. Know what applies to you.

**Protect intellectual property.** Make sure employees assign their work to the company. Consider trademarking your brand and important product names.

**Get insurance.** General liability, professional liability, and directors and officers insurance can protect you from catastrophic risks.

**Stay current on employment law.** Hiring, firing, and managing employees involves legal requirements that change over time.

## Technology Infrastructure

Your technology choices in the early days will affect your company for years. Choose carefully.

**Use standard, proven technologies.** Save the cutting-edge stuff for problems that actually require it. Boring technology is usually better technology.

**Plan for growth but don't over-engineer.** You need systems that can scale, but you don't need to build for Google-scale traffic from day one.

**Invest in security early.** Security problems are expensive and embarrassing. Build good security practices from the beginning.

**Back up everything important.** Data loss can kill companies. Have reliable backups and test them regularly.

**Monitor system health.** Know when things break before your customers tell you. Use monitoring tools to track performance and uptime.

**Document your systems.** Other people need to understand how your technology works. Don't let critical knowledge live only in one person's head.

## Customer Support

Customer support is not a cost center - it's a competitive advantage. Companies with great support can charge more and keep customers longer.

**Respond quickly.** Speed of response often matters more than quality of response. Acknowledge customer issues immediately, even if you can't solve them right away.

**Empower support staff to solve problems.** Don't make customers wait while support staff check with managers. Give your team authority to make customers happy.

**Track support metrics.** Response time, resolution time, customer satisfaction. Measure what matters and work to improve it.

**Learn from support conversations.** Customer support is market research. Pay attention to patterns in customer problems and requests.

**Make it easy for customers to get help.** Multiple channels, clear documentation, intuitive contact methods.

## Quality Control

Quality problems are expensive. They cost money to fix, damage customer relationships, and hurt your reputation.

**Build quality into your processes.** Don't try to inspect quality in after the fact. Design processes that naturally produce good results.

**Create feedback loops.** How do you know when quality is slipping? Build systems that surface problems quickly.

**Empower employees to stop production.** Anyone should be able to halt a process if they spot a quality problem.

**Learn from mistakes.** When something goes wrong, figure out why and how to prevent it from happening again.

**Balance quality and speed.** Perfect quality isn't always worth the cost and delay. Understand what level of quality your customers actually need.

## Scaling Operations

What works at 10 people breaks at 50 people. What works at 50 people breaks at 200 people. Plan for the transitions.

**Identify bottlenecks early.** What will break first as you grow? Address these constraints before they become problems.

**Standardize before you scale.** It's hard to train new people if every existing person does things differently.

**Invest in tools and automation.** Manual processes that work fine for a small team become impossible at scale.

**Build management capability.** Growing companies need people who can manage people. This is a different skill set from doing the work.

**Maintain culture deliberately.** Company culture changes as you grow. If you want to preserve what's important, you have to work at it intentionally.

The goal of operations is to build a company that runs smoothly without constant founder intervention. This frees you to focus on strategy, vision, and the big decisions that only founders can make.
