# AI Overview

*Building in the age of artificial intelligence*

AI startups are the most overhyped and underhyped category simultaneously. Overhyped because everyone thinks they're building an AI company. Underhyped because the actual opportunities are larger than most people realize.

The key insight: AI isn't a product category. It's a new way to build products in every category.

## What's Different About AI Startups

**The technology is advancing exponentially.** Your competitive advantage today might be irrelevant in six months. Plan accordingly.

**Data is your moat.** Unlike traditional software, AI products get better with more usage. Network effects can be stronger than in any other startup category.

**Compute costs are real.** Your marginal costs might not approach zero like traditional software. Unit economics matter from day one.

**Talent is expensive and scarce.** Good AI engineers command higher salaries and more equity than traditional software engineers.

## Types of AI Startups

**Application layer.** You use existing AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) to solve specific problems. Easiest to start, hardest to defend.

**Model layer.** You build and train your own models. Harder to start, but potentially stronger moats.

**Infrastructure layer.** You build tools that other AI companies use. Picks and shovels approach.

**Data layer.** You create or curate datasets that make AI models better. Often overlooked but can be highly valuable.

## The AI Startup Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Wrapper (0-6 months)**
You build an application using existing AI APIs. This is fine as a starting point but isn't defensible long-term.

**Phase 2: Data Collection (6-18 months)**
You use your application to collect proprietary data. This data becomes your competitive advantage.

**Phase 3: Custom Models (18+ months)**
You use your data to train models that outperform general-purpose ones for your use case.

## Common AI Mistakes

**Thinking AI solves everything.** AI is a tool, not magic. Start with a real problem, then figure out if AI helps solve it.

**Ignoring the human in the loop.** Most successful AI products augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely.

**Underestimating data requirements.** Good AI products need lots of high-quality, domain-specific data. Plan for this from day one.

**Chasing the latest model.** GPT-5 won't save your startup if GPT-4 doesn't work for your use case.

## Unique Opportunities

**Vertical AI.** General-purpose AI tools are commoditizing. Specialized tools for specific industries or workflows are not.

**AI-native products.** Don't just add AI features to existing products. Build products that are only possible because AI exists.

**Human-AI collaboration.** The best AI products make humans more capable, not obsolete.

## Building Your AI Moat

**Proprietary data.** The more domain-specific data you have, the better your models become.

**User feedback loops.** Design your product so user interactions improve your AI over time.

**Network effects.** More users = more data = better models = more users.

**Speed of execution.** In a fast-moving field, being first to market with a good solution matters more than usual.

## Getting Started

Don't start with the AI. Start with the problem. Then ask: would AI make the solution 10x better, or just incrementally better?

If it's 10x better, you might have an AI startup. If it's incremental, you probably have a traditional startup that uses AI.

Both can succeed. But they require different strategies.
