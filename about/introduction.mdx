# The Pragmatic Startup Guide

Most startup advice is either obvious or wrong. The obvious advice - "talk to customers," "build something people want" - doesn't help you make hard decisions. The wrong advice treats all startups the same, ignoring the fundamental differences between a SaaS company and a hardware startup.

This guide is different. It's organized around the stages every startup goes through: Foundation, Execution, and Growth. Each section covers what you need to know at that stage, with specific advice based on what actually works.

## What This Guide Covers

**Foundation:** The early decisions that determine everything else. How to find ideas worth pursuing, build the right team, set up your legal structure, and understand your market.

**Execution:** Building and growing your business. Product development, customer acquisition, operations, and metrics that matter.

**Growth:** Scaling and eventual exit. Fundraising, business models, scaling operations, and planning for exits.

The goal isn't to give you a step-by-step formula. Startups are too variable for that. Instead, this guide helps you understand the principles behind successful startups so you can make better decisions for your specific situation.

## What Doesn't Change

Despite constant talk about how everything is different now, the fundamentals of startups haven't changed much:

- Solve a real problem for real people
- Build something people actually want
- Figure out how to make money
- Get customers to pay more than it costs to serve them

Everything else is tactics. Important tactics, but tactics that vary based on your business, market, and stage.

## How to Use This Guide

**If you're just starting out:** Read through Foundation first. These are the decisions you can't easily change later.

**If you're building your first product:** Focus on the Execution section. This covers product development, finding customers, and building systems.

**If you're ready to scale:** The Growth section covers fundraising, business models, scaling operations, and eventual exits.

**If you're unsure where you are:** Start with Foundation. Most problems in later stages trace back to decisions made early.

## A Different Approach

Most startup advice comes from two sources: successful founders generalizing from their own experience, and investors who've seen many companies but haven't built them.

This guide synthesizes both perspectives but focuses on what works consistently across many companies and industries. It's heavily inspired by Paul Graham's essays and approach to thinking about startups - direct, thoughtful, and focused on fundamental principles rather than trendy tactics.

The writing style intentionally mirrors Graham's: simple, specific, and unafraid to state uncomfortable truths. The best startup advice doesn't try to impress you with jargon or complexity. It helps you see clearly through the noise to what actually matters.

This guide aims to be that kind of advice.
