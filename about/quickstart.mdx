# Quick Start

If you want to start a company but don't know where to begin, here's the shortest path that actually works.

Most people overcomplicate this. They write business plans, create pitch decks, and design logos before they've talked to a single potential customer. This is backwards.

## Week 1: Find a Problem

Start with a problem you've personally experienced. Not something you read about or think might be a problem. Something that has genuinely annoyed you enough that you'd pay to fix it.

The best startup ideas come from founders' own frustration. The founders of Airbnb couldn't afford rent and needed extra income. The Stripe founders were developers frustrated with payment processing. This pattern repeats constantly.

**This week:**
- Write down 10 problems you've encountered recently
- Talk to 5 other people who might have these problems
- Pick the one that makes people's faces change when you describe it

You'll know you've found a real problem when people interrupt you to tell their own stories about it.

## Week 2: Build the Simplest Solution

Don't build a business plan. Build something you can show people.

It doesn't matter if it's ugly or incomplete. It needs to demonstrate your core idea. If you're solving a scheduling problem, build a basic scheduling tool. If you're improving email, make a simple email interface.

If you can't code, use no-code tools or find someone who can. The medium matters less than having something tangible.

**This week:**
- Build the most basic version of your solution
- Show it to 10 potential users
- Write down exactly what they say (word for word, not your interpretation)

## Week 3: Get One Real User

One person who actually uses your product is worth more than 100 people who say they would use it.

This is where most people get stuck. They keep "improving" their product instead of finding users for what they already have. Don't do this. Real usage teaches you what needs improving.

**This week:**
- Get one person to use your product regularly
- Ask them what would make it worth paying for
- Build that specific improvement

## Month 2: Validate or Pivot

After a month of real usage, you'll know if you're building something people want. The signs are obvious:

- People use it without constant reminders
- They complain when it's broken or unavailable
- They ask for specific new features
- Some volunteer to pay for it

If you're not seeing these signs, that's valuable information. Most startup ideas don't work. The key is discovering this quickly and cheaply.

**If it's working:** Get more users and start charging money.

**If it's not working:** Try a different solution to the same problem, or find a different problem.

## What Happens Next

Once you have something people want and will pay for, your next steps depend on what you're building and where you are:

**Foundation stage:** Make key early decisions about your team, legal structure, and market approach. Read the Foundation section.

**Execution stage:** Focus on product development, customer acquisition, and building systems. Read the Execution section.

**Growth stage:** Think about fundraising, scaling, and long-term strategy. Read the Growth section.

Most founders should start with Foundation, even if they've already built something. Early decisions are hard to change later.

## Common Mistakes

**Optimizing before validating.** Don't spend months perfecting a product before anyone has used it.

**Building in stealth mode.** Unless you're working on something genuinely secret, stealth is usually procrastination.

**Waiting for the perfect idea.** Most successful companies started with imperfect ideas that evolved through customer feedback.

**Trying to do everything yourself.** Find co-founders or early employees who complement your skills.

**Ignoring the business model.** Figure out how you'll make money early, not as an afterthought.

## The Meta-Point

The real quick start is this: find a problem you have, build something to solve it, and get someone else to pay for that solution.

Everything else - business plans, funding, hiring, scaling - comes after you've proven that basic loop works.

Most startup advice focuses on the everything else. But if you can't make that basic loop work, nothing else matters.
