title: "When to Ignore Advice"
description: "Filtering signal from noise in a noisy ecosystem"

Everyone has opinions about how to build startups. Most of this advice is wrong for your specific situation. Learning when to ignore advice is more valuable than learning when to follow it.

## The Source Matters More Than the Content

**Advice from people who haven't built successful businesses:** Business school professors, consultants, government officials, and journalists often give confident advice about startup building despite never having done it successfully themselves.

**Advice from people in different contexts:** Silicon Valley advice might not apply to MENA markets. B2C advice might not apply to B2B companies. Advice from five years ago might not apply to today's conditions.

**Advice from people with different goals:** VCs optimize for portfolio returns, not individual company success. Accelerators optimize for demo day presentations, not sustainable businesses. Government programs optimize for job creation metrics, not company outcomes.

**Generic advice that applies to everyone:** If the advice would work equally well for any startup in any industry, it's probably too general to be useful for your specific situation.

## Red Flags in Startup Advice

**"You should" statements without context:** "You should raise 18-24 months of runway" or "You should never give equity to advisors." Rules without context are usually wrong.

**Advice that assumes you have options:** Much startup advice assumes you can choose between multiple investors, hire from a large talent pool, or select your market. Most founders don't have these luxuries.

**Survivorship bias:** Success stories that don't account for all the companies that tried the same approach and failed. "Company X succeeded by doing Y" doesn't mean Y causes success.

**Complexity bias:** Advice that makes simple problems seem complicated. If someone's advice requires elaborate frameworks or multi-step processes, be skeptical.

## When to Definitely Ignore Advice

**When it contradicts direct evidence from your users.** If your customers tell you they want one thing but advisors tell you to build something else, listen to your customers.

**When it's based on outdated assumptions.** "Nobody will pay for mobile apps" or "Social networks can't monetize" might have been true once but aren't true now.

**When it assumes resources you don't have.** Advice that requires large marketing budgets, extensive legal teams, or months of development time might not work for early-stage companies.

**When it optimizes for the wrong metrics.** Advice focused on fundraising success, media coverage, or growth metrics might not help you build a sustainable business.

## The MENA Context Filter

**Advice that assumes Western business practices:** Payment methods, contract negotiation styles, hiring practices, and customer behavior work differently in MENA markets.

**Advice that ignores regulatory realities:** Some business models that work in other regions aren't legal or practical in MENA markets due to regulatory constraints.

**Advice that assumes mature ecosystem support:** Silicon Valley advice often assumes access to experienced talent, sophisticated investors, and established service providers that might not exist in your market.

**Advice that ignores cultural considerations:** Family decision-making patterns, religious considerations, and social expectations affect business building in ways that generic startup advice doesn't address.

## How to Evaluate Advice

**Consider the advisor's track record:** Have they successfully built businesses similar to yours? Do they understand your market and customer base?

**Look for specific, actionable guidance:** Good advice tells you exactly what to do in your specific situation. Vague principles are less useful than concrete recommendations.

**Test advice with small experiments:** Instead of following advice completely, test it on a small scale and see if it works for your situation.

**Ask about failure modes:** What could go wrong if you follow this advice? Good advisors acknowledge risks and limitations.

**Check for conflicts of interest:** Does the advisor benefit if you follow their advice? VCs who want you to raise money, service providers who want you to buy their services, and employees who want equity all have biased perspectives.

## Common Bad Advice in MENA

**"Focus on the local market first":** Sometimes international markets are easier to enter than local markets, especially for B2B software or digital products.

**"You need a local partner":** Local partnerships can be valuable, but they're not always necessary and sometimes create more problems than they solve.

**"Raise money from regional investors":** Regional investors might not be the best fit for your business model or growth plans. International investors are sometimes better options.

**"Build for mobile first":** While mobile usage is high in MENA, some business problems are better solved with web applications or desktop software.

**"Copy successful Western models":** What works in Silicon Valley or London might not work in Cairo or Dubai due to different market conditions and user behaviors.

## Advice Worth Taking Seriously

**Specific tactical guidance from people solving similar problems:** How to set up international banking, which legal structures work for different business models, how to hire engineers in specific markets.

**Warnings about common mistakes:** Regulatory pitfalls, partnership structures that don't work, hiring practices that lead to problems.

**Customer development insights:** How to find and talk to potential customers, how to interpret user feedback, how to test product-market fit.

**Operational knowledge:** How to manage remote teams, how to handle cross-border payments, how to scale customer support.

## The Decision Framework

**Does this advice apply to my specific situation?** Consider your industry, stage, market, and resources.

**Does the advisor have relevant experience?** Have they built businesses in similar contexts with similar constraints?

**Can I test this advice with low risk?** Is there a way to try this approach without betting the entire company on it?

**Does this advice contradict what I've learned from direct experience?** Your direct experience with customers and markets usually beats generic advice.

**What are the failure modes?** What happens if this advice turns out to be wrong for my situation?

Most advice is well-intentioned but wrong for your specific context. The best founders develop good judgment about when to listen and when to trust their own experience instead.

The goal isn't to ignore all adviceâ€”it's to filter for advice that's relevant, actionable, and comes from people who understand your situation. Everything else is just noise.
