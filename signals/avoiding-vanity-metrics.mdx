title: "Avoiding Vanity Metrics"
description: "Why measuring the wrong things kills startups faster than measuring nothing"
---

A Cairo startup celebrated reaching 10,000 app downloads. Six months later, they shut down with 12 paying customers. A Dubai company boasted about being featured in 15 publications. Their revenue was flat for two years. A Saudi founder raised money based on "engagement metrics" that looked impressive but generated no business value.

Vanity metrics feel like progress but don't correlate with business success. In MENA's emerging tech ecosystem, where everyone is eager to show growth, vanity metrics are especially dangerous because they become the currency of credibility.

## What Makes a Metric Vanity

**It doesn't predict future revenue.** Downloads, page views, social media followers, and press mentions might feel good, but they don't tell you if people will pay for what you're building.

**It can be gamed without creating value.** If you can improve the metric through spending money or manipulating systems rather than building something people want, it's probably vanity.

**It doesn't lead to actionable decisions.** Good metrics tell you what to do next. Vanity metrics just tell you what happened, without guidance on how to improve.

**It makes you feel successful when you're not.** The most dangerous vanity metrics are the ones that create false confidence while your business fundamentals deteriorate.

## The MENA Vanity Metric Problem

**Ecosystem incentives reward vanity metrics.** Accelerators, government programs, and media coverage often focus on growth metrics that don't correlate with business sustainability. This creates pressure to optimize for the wrong things.

**Limited benchmarking data makes vanity metrics seem important.** When you can't easily compare your performance to similar companies, metrics like app downloads or website traffic feel significant even when they're not predictive of success.

**Relationship-based business culture values perception.** In markets where reputation and relationships drive business opportunities, appearing successful through vanity metrics can feel more important than being profitable through boring metrics.

**International investors expect Silicon Valley metrics.** MENA founders often focus on metrics that sound impressive to international investors rather than metrics that actually predict local business success.

## Real Metrics That Matter

**Revenue metrics:**
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for subscription businesses
- Customer lifetime value (LTV) vs customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Revenue per customer and revenue growth rate
- Time to payback customer acquisition costs

**Usage metrics that predict payment:**
- Daily/monthly active users who complete core actions
- Feature usage that correlates with customer retention
- Time spent on high-value activities (not just time on site)
- User actions that indicate increasing engagement over time

**Business health metrics:**
- Customer retention rates over time
- Net promoter score from paying customers
- Gross margins and unit economics
- Cash burn rate and months of runway

## The Correlation Test

For any metric you're tracking, ask: "If this number doubles, does my revenue predictably increase?" If the answer is no, it's probably vanity.

**Revenue doubling:** Definitely correlates with business success.

**Paying customers doubling:** Strong correlation with business success.

**Website traffic doubling:** Might correlate with business success, might not. Depends on conversion rates and traffic quality.

**Social media followers doubling:** Weak correlation with business success for most businesses.

**Press mentions doubling:** Usually no correlation with business success.

## Ecosystem Navigation Strategy

**Understand what different stakeholders actually care about.** Accelerators might care about growth metrics for their own reporting, but they ultimately want companies that become successful. Focus on metrics that predict success rather than metrics that look good in presentations.

**Separate public metrics from private metrics.** You might need to report certain metrics for ecosystem participation, but internally focus on metrics that drive business decisions.

**Educate ecosystem partners about meaningful metrics.** Help accelerators, investors, and partners understand which metrics actually predict success in your market and business model.

**Use vanity metrics strategically, not operationally.** Press coverage and social media presence can help with partnership development and recruitment, but don't let them drive product or business decisions.

## Common MENA Vanity Metric Traps

**Government program metrics:** Job creation numbers, "innovation" indicators, and economic impact projections often don't correlate with building sustainable businesses.

**Accelerator demo day metrics:** Growth rates over short periods, total addressable market sizes, and "potential" metrics designed to impress audiences rather than predict success.

**Media coverage metrics:** Number of articles, conference speaking opportunities, and industry awards that feel like validation but don't indicate market demand.

**Partnership metrics:** Number of partnerships signed, MoUs executed, or "strategic relationships" that don't translate to revenue or customer acquisition.

## Building a Real Metrics Culture

**Measure what you can control.** Focus on metrics that change based on your actions rather than external factors you can't influence.

**Track leading indicators, not just lagging indicators.** Revenue is important, but also track the actions that lead to revenue (qualified leads, product usage patterns, customer engagement).

**Review metrics weekly, not monthly.** Monthly reviews don't give you enough feedback loops to make rapid improvements.

**Connect metrics to specific actions.** For every metric you track, know what you'll do differently if it goes up or down.

## The Honesty Test

The most dangerous vanity metrics are the ones you use to lie to yourself. Ask honestly:

- Are you tracking this metric because it makes you feel good or because it predicts success?
- Would you rather have this metric improve or have your revenue improve?
- If you had to choose one metric to track for the next year, would it be this one?
- Are you sharing this metric with investors because it's impressive or because it's predictive?

## What to Do Instead

**Start with revenue.** If you're not making money, track the activities most directly connected to future revenue.

**Measure retention before acquisition.** It's easier to acquire new customers than to fix fundamental retention problems.

**Track qualitative feedback from paying customers.** What they say about your product matters more than aggregate usage statistics.

**Focus on unit economics.** Understand the economics of acquiring and serving individual customers before worrying about scale metrics.

The goal isn't to avoid all early-stage metricsâ€”it's to avoid metrics that create false confidence while your business fails. In MENA's developing ecosystem, where everyone wants to show progress, focusing on real metrics becomes a competitive advantage.

Paul Graham's essay [The Other Road Ahead](http://paulgraham.com/road.html) discusses how focusing on the wrong metrics can lead startups astray. His emphasis on building something people want, measured through actual usage and payment, provides a framework for distinguishing meaningful metrics from vanity metrics.
