title: "Measuring Your Competitive Position"

A payments startup in Lebanon thought they were safe because they understood local banking relationships better than international competitors. Then Revolut applied for their banking license. A delivery company in Kuwait believed their local network gave them an unassailable advantage. Then Talabat was acquired by Delivery Hero for $170M and scaled across the region with global resources.

Being the "local option" isn't a competitive advantage—it's a temporary head start that expires the moment a well-funded global player decides your market is worth entering.

## The Local Advantage Illusion

**You know the market better.** But global competitors hire local teams who know the market just as well, plus they have proven playbooks from other markets.

**You have existing relationships.** But global competitors can buy market share, acquire local players, or partner with established businesses that already have those relationships.

**You understand cultural nuances.** But global competitors adapt quickly and have resources to test and iterate until they get the culture right.

**Regulation protects you.** But regulations change, especially when governments want to attract international investment and competition.

The founders who survive global competition aren't the ones who hope their local advantages will protect them—they're the ones who build defensible businesses that work whether competition is local or global.

## The Real Competitive Analysis Framework

Instead of comparing yourself to current local competitors, measure yourself against the global standard for your category. Here's how:

**Revenue per customer:** How much do you make per customer compared to the global leaders in your space? If Stripe makes $X per payment processed and you make much less, you're vulnerable to a global player offering better unit economics.

**Customer acquisition cost:** How much do you spend to acquire each customer? Global competitors often have better CAC because of proven marketing playbooks, brand recognition, and economies of scale.

**Market penetration rate:** What percentage of your target market actually uses your product? If it's low, a well-funded competitor can capture the majority of customers you haven't reached yet.

**Switching costs:** How hard would it be for your customers to move to a competitor? If switching is easy, you have no moat.

**Time to value:** How quickly do new customers get meaningful value from your product? Global competitors excel at onboarding and time-to-value optimization.

## The Defensibility Assessment

**Network effects:** Does your product get better as more people use it? WhatsApp became harder to compete with as more people joined. Most MENA startups don't have real network effects—they just have more users.

**Data advantages:** Do you have proprietary data that makes your product better? Careem's data about traffic patterns and driver behavior was valuable. Generic customer data is not.

**Brand and trust:** Would customers choose you even if a competitor offered the same product at a lower price? Strong brands can survive price competition. Weak brands cannot.

**Regulatory moats:** Are there real regulatory barriers that would prevent global competitors from entering? Banking licenses create moats. Business registration requirements do not.

**Capital efficiency:** Can you grow profitably while competitors need to burn cash? If you need to raise money every 18 months to survive, you're vulnerable to competitors who can operate profitably or have deeper pockets.

## Competitive Intelligence That Actually Matters

**Who's raising money in your space globally:** VCs often fund multiple companies in the same category across different markets. If a company similar to yours raises a large round in Europe or Asia, they might expand to MENA next.

**Which global companies are hiring locally:** Check LinkedIn and local job boards. When Uber, Amazon, or Netflix start hiring country managers and local operations teams, expansion usually follows within 12-18 months.

**Partnership and acquisition activity:** Global companies often enter new markets by acquiring local players or partnering with established businesses. Monitor deal activity in your sector.

**Regulatory changes:** New financial services regulations, e-commerce rules, or visa policies often signal that governments are preparing for increased international competition.

**Infrastructure development:** Improved payment systems, logistics networks, and digital infrastructure make markets more attractive to global competitors.

## MENA-Specific Competitive Vulnerabilities

**Subsidized competition:** Global competitors can lose money in MENA while making profits elsewhere. Local startups usually can't sustain losses as long as global competitors with diversified revenue streams.

**Talent arbitrage:** Global companies can attract top MENA talent with equity packages, international career opportunities, and higher cash compensation than most local startups can offer.

**Capital access:** Global competitors can raise money in multiple markets and currencies. MENA startups are usually limited to regional funding sources with smaller check sizes.

**Platform leverage:** Amazon can launch new services for existing customers. Google can promote new products through existing touchpoints. Netflix can add new content categories. Most MENA startups serve single-purpose use cases.

**Government relationships:** Governments often prioritize relationships with large international companies over local startups, especially for major contracts and regulatory discussions.

## Building Real Competitive Advantages

**Focus on the hardest problems:** Global competitors usually enter markets by solving the easiest problems first. If you solve the complex, culturally specific problems that require deep local knowledge, you're harder to displace.

**Build switching costs:** Create products where customers would lose significant time, money, or convenience by switching to competitors. This usually means integrating deeply into customer workflows rather than providing standalone tools.

**Develop proprietary data:** Collect and analyze data that makes your product better over time and can't be easily replicated by competitors who start later.

**Establish platform dynamics:** Build products where other businesses depend on you to reach customers. Marketplaces, payment processors, and infrastructure providers have more defensible positions than single-service applications.

**Create capital efficiency:** Build businesses that can grow profitably without constant fundraising. This gives you independence from funding market conditions and makes you less vulnerable to competitors who can outspend you temporarily.

## The Competitive Reality Check

**Monthly:** Track your key metrics against global benchmarks in your industry. Are you closing the gap or falling further behind?

**Quarterly:** Research funding activity, hiring activity, and regulatory changes that might signal incoming competition.

**Annually:** Honestly assess whether your competitive advantages are getting stronger or weaker. Most founders overestimate how defensible their businesses are.

## When Global Competition Arrives

**Don't panic and make desperate moves:** Price wars, rushed feature launches, and expensive marketing campaigns usually make your position worse, not better.

**Focus on what you do better:** Identify the specific customer needs where you deliver more value than the new competitor and double down on serving those customers exceptionally well.

**Consider partnership opportunities:** Sometimes the best defense against global competition is partnering with global competitors, especially if you have complementary strengths.

**Plan your exit strategy:** If you can't realistically compete long-term, selling to a strategic acquirer or merging with a stronger competitor might create more value than fighting an unwinnable battle.

The goal isn't to hide from global competition—it's to build businesses that can compete successfully whether your competition is local or global. In most cases, this means building better products, serving customers more effectively, and operating more efficiently than you would if you only had to compete locally.

Most successful MENA startups got acquired by global companies or became regional platforms themselves. Very few stayed purely local and survived long-term. Plan accordingly.
