Most startup exit advice focuses on IPOs and strategic acquisitions by large corporations. But in MENA, some of the most successful exits follow different patterns: management buyouts, private equity rollups, family office acquisitions, and cross-border consolidation plays that don't make TechCrunch headlines.

A fintech that understands Islamic banking regulations might be invaluable to a global bank entering MENA markets.
