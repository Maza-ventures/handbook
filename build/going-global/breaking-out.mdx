title: "Breaking Out of the Region Before It Breaks You"
description: "Why staying regional too long can kill your ambitions"

There's a comfortable trap in MENA: building a nice regional business that works well in 3-4 countries and generates enough revenue to feel successful. The problem is that regional success can become a ceiling if you're not careful. You optimize for local market dynamics, build relationships that only work regionally, and lose the hunger to compete globally.

The companies that break out are usually the ones that maintain global ambitions from day one, even when they're executing locally. They build products that happen to work well in MENA but aren't limited to MENA. They hire people who understand international markets. They measure themselves against global competitors, not just regional ones.
