title: "What Investors Actually Look For"
description: "Evidence over promises, traction over projections"
---

Investors want to see evidence that you can build a business that generates returns. The specific criteria vary by investor type, stage, and region, but certain fundamentals apply consistently.

## Universal Investor Priorities

**Evidence of customer demand.** Revenue, usage growth, customer retention, or other metrics that prove people actually want what you're building.

**Understanding of unit economics.** How much it costs to acquire customers, how much they pay you, and how long they stay customers. If you don't understand these numbers, neither will investors.

**Ability to execute.** Building products that work, hitting stated milestones, and demonstrating progress between meetings.

**Market opportunity that justifies their investment size.** They need to believe you can grow large enough to generate meaningful returns on their investment.

**Team that can scale the business.** The skills and experience to take the company from current stage to the next major milestone.

## What Different Investor Types Prioritize

**Angel investors:** Problem-solution fit, founder credibility, early traction signals, reasonable valuation.

**Seed funds:** Product-market fit evidence, early revenue or strong usage metrics, clear path to scale, experienced team.

**Series A+ funds:** Revenue growth rate, market size, competitive advantages, operational efficiency, path to profitability.

**Family offices:** Profitable business models, conservative growth projections, local market understanding, experienced management.

**Strategic investors:** Alignment with their business goals, potential for partnerships, market access, technology synergies.

## How to Present Evidence Effectively

**Lead with metrics that matter.** Revenue growth, customer retention, unit economics. Don't bury these in later slides.

**Show actual customer behavior.** Usage data, retention curves, customer feedback, case studies with real names and numbers.

**Demonstrate operational capability.** Hit the milestones you commit to, maintain consistent communication, provide accurate information.

**Be specific about how you'll use their money.** Hiring plans, marketing budgets, product development timelines with concrete deliverables.

## Common Pitching Mistakes

**Leading with market size.** "This is a $50 billion market" doesn't tell investors whether you can build a profitable business serving part of that market.

**Focusing on features instead of customer value.** Investors care about why customers pay you, not what features you've built.

**Overly optimistic projections.** Hockey stick growth curves without explaining how you'll achieve them make investors skeptical.

**Copying other companies' fundraising narratives.** "We're the Uber for X" doesn't explain why you'll succeed where others might fail.

**Avoiding difficult questions.** Addressing obvious concerns directly builds credibility better than hoping investors won't notice them.

## Building Investor Relationships

**Start conversations before you need money.** The best time to meet investors is when you don't need capital but can show them interesting progress.

**Provide regular updates.** Monthly or quarterly updates about metrics, milestones, and challenges keep you visible to potential investors.

**Be selective about who you talk to.** Not every investor is right for your business. Research their portfolio, investment criteria, and reputation before pitching.

**Ask for specific help, not just money.** Investors respond better when you explain exactly how they can add value beyond capital.

## Due Diligence Preparation

**Clean legal and financial records.** Proper incorporation, employment agreements, financial statements, and IP ownership documentation.

**Organized data room.** Financial metrics, legal documents, product information, and customer references easily accessible to investors.

**Reference preparation.** Customers, employees, and advisors who can speak positively about your business and team.

**Competitive analysis.** Understanding of market landscape, competitor strengths and weaknesses, and your differentiation strategy.

<Warning>
**The Fundraising Time Trap**
Fundraising takes 3-6 months of focused effort. During this time, product development and business growth often slow down. Plan accordingly and don't start fundraising unless you have enough runway to complete the process.
</Warning>

## Regional Considerations

**Different investors have different risk appetites.** Some focus on proven business models, others invest in innovative but unproven approaches.

**Regulatory and market knowledge varies.** Investors with local market experience might be more comfortable with regulatory challenges than international investors.

**Network effects matter.** Investors with strong local networks can provide valuable introductions to customers, partners, and talent.

**Currency and exit preferences.** Some investors prefer local currency deals, others require international structures for exit optionality.

## When You're Ready to Raise

**You have clear metrics that show business momentum.** Growing revenue, usage, or other indicators that your business is working.

**You know how additional capital will accelerate growth.** Specific plans for hiring, marketing, or product development that require funding.

**You can realistically achieve the next major milestone.** Series A metrics if you're raising seed, profitability if you're raising growth capital.

**You have 9+ months of runway.** Enough time to complete fundraising without desperation affecting your negotiations.

The goal isn't to convince investors to believe in your visionâ€”it's to provide evidence that your business is working and additional capital will help it grow faster.
