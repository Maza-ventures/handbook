SAFE notes were designed for Silicon Valley, not for markets where a significant portion of investors require Sharia-compliant structures. The good news is that convertible equity can be structured to comply with Islamic finance principles, but it requires understanding what makes an investment halal or haram.

The core issue with conventional convertible notes is that they create debt with interest, which violates Islamic finance principles. SAFE notes solve this by being equity instruments rather than debt, but they still need careful structuring to ensure compliance with Sharia requirements around uncertainty (gharar) and speculation (maysir).
