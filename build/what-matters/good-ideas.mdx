title: "How to Tell if Your Idea is Good"
description: "Testing demand through behavior, not opinions"

The most reliable way to validate startup ideas is to observe what people actually do, not what they say they'll do. However, the best validation method depends on your specific situation—your product type, development timeline, and market context.

## When Payment-Based Validation Works Best

**Payment validation is most reliable when:**
- Customers have discretionary budgets for your solution type
- The payment amount represents meaningful commitment relative to customer resources  
- Your product can be meaningfully evaluated through short-term usage
- Cultural context treats direct payment as a normal decision-making signal
- You can deliver value within weeks or months, not years

**Why payment beats opinions in these contexts:**

**People are bad at predicting their own behavior.** They'll say they want products they'll never buy, especially when expressing interest costs nothing.

**Payment requires sacrifice.** When someone gives you money, they're making a real trade-off between your solution and everything else they could spend money on.

**Pre-payment is even stronger.** If people will pay for something before it exists, they have a real problem they need solved urgently.

**Usage patterns reveal true value.** How people actually use your product tells you more about its utility than what they say about it.

## Testing Ideas Before Building

**Sell the outcome manually.** Before building software, deliver the result manually for a few customers. If a tool would save people time, save their time yourself and charge for it.

**Create simple landing pages.** Build basic pages describing your solution and measure specific actions: payment attempts, detailed inquiries, or email signups with specific use cases.

**Offer pre-orders or waiting lists.** If people won't join a waiting list or pre-order, they probably won't buy when it's ready.

**Start with one specific use case.** Don't build a platform—build a tool that solves one specific problem extremely well.

## What Makes Ideas Actually Good

**You understand the problem personally.** The best startup ideas come from problems founders have experienced directly. You know the nuances, workarounds, and pain points that outsiders miss.

**People are already paying for inadequate solutions.** If people are spending money on poor solutions or complex workarounds, there's proven demand for something better.

**The problem is frequent or expensive.** Either it happens often enough that small improvements add up, or it's painful enough that people will pay substantial amounts for solutions.

**You can identify the first 10 customers.** If you can't name specific people who would pay for this in the next three months, you don't understand the problem well enough yet.

## A Simple Testing Process

**Week 1:** Build a simple explanation of what you'd build and who it's for. Create a basic landing page.

**Week 2:** Find 10 people who have this problem and show them your explanation. Count how many ask follow-up questions about pricing or availability.

**Week 3:** Offer to solve the problem manually for 3 of them in exchange for payment. See how many say yes.

**Week 4:** Actually deliver the manual solution. Measure whether they use it and whether they'd pay for it again.

If this process doesn't generate clear evidence of demand, either the problem isn't as important as you thought, or your solution doesn't adequately address it.

## Common Validation Mistakes

**Asking hypothetical questions.** "Would you pay $50/month for this?" gets hypothetical answers. Instead, ask: "How do you currently solve this problem and what does it cost you?"

**Confusing interest with demand.** People saying "that's a good idea" or "I would use that" isn't demand. Demand is people asking when they can start paying for it.

**Optimizing for perfect solutions instead of better solutions.** You don't need to build the ideal solution—just one that's significantly better than what people use now.

**Focusing on large markets instead of specific customers.** Market size doesn't matter if you can't identify and reach specific people who need your solution urgently.

<Warning>
**The Validation Theater Trap**
Don't spend months collecting opinions from potential customers while avoiding the hard work of actually building something testable. Opinions are easy to collect and feel like progress, but they don't correlate with business success.
</Warning>

## When to Stop Researching and Start Building

**For consumer/business software:**
- When you can clearly explain the problem and solution in one sentence each
- When you've identified specific people who currently pay money to solve this problem
- When you have a simple way to test your core assumption through a minimal version

**For deep tech/hardware:**
- When you've validated the technical feasibility through proof-of-concept
- When you understand the regulatory and compliance requirements 
- When you've identified potential customers willing to participate in pilots
- When you have funding secured for the development timeline required

**Universal signals to start building:**
- When you're spending more time talking about the idea than working on it
- When additional research yields diminishing insights about the core problem
- When you have a clear hypothesis you can test through building rather than just research

The key is matching your validation approach to your product timeline and development requirements.

The goal isn't to eliminate risk—it's to test your biggest assumptions as quickly and cheaply as possible. Good ideas usually seem obvious in retrospect, but they require testing to distinguish from bad ideas that also seem obvious.
