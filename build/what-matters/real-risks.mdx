title: "The Real Risks: Not Trying vs. Failing"
description: "Why the biggest risk is playing it safe"

Most people in MENA are terrified of the wrong risks. They worry about failing publicly, disappointing family expectations, or not having a backup plan. These are small risks compared to the risk of not trying at all—of spending your career working on someone else's vision instead of your own.

The real risk is that the opportunity you see today won't exist in five years. Someone else will solve the problem you identified. The market will mature. The regulatory environment will change. The window for being first to market will close. By the time you feel "ready" to start, the opportunity will be gone.

This is especially true in MENA, where markets are changing rapidly. The infrastructure limitations that create opportunities today are being solved by governments and large corporations. The regulatory uncertainty that keeps big players away won't last forever. If you wait for perfect conditions, you'll miss the best opportunities.

## Failure is Temporary, Regret is Permanent

In MENA's relationship-based business culture, people often worry that failure will damage their reputation permanently. But the opposite is usually true. People respect founders who tried and failed more than people who never tried at all. A failed startup is evidence that you have initiative, can handle responsibility, and understand how business works.

More importantly, failure teaches you things that you can't learn any other way. It teaches you how to make decisions under pressure, how to manage people, how to deal with uncertainty. These skills are valuable regardless of whether your startup succeeds. They make you better at whatever you do next.

The founders who succeed are usually not the ones who succeeded on their first try—they're the ones who learned from their failures and applied those lessons to their next attempt. Each failure makes the next attempt more likely to succeed, as long as you're learning from your mistakes rather than repeating them.
