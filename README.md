# The Pragmatic MENA Startup Handbook

A practical guide for MENA founders building global software products. Heavily inspired by Paul Graham with regional context and real-world advice.

## About This Handbook

This handbook addresses the unique challenges MENA startups face when building global software companies—from navigating mandated funding to breaking out of regional market traps. It's built on the principle that while business fundamentals are universal, execution requires understanding local context.

**Target audience:** MENA founders building software products for global markets
**Philosophy:** Pragmatic advice over theoretical frameworks
**Style:** Direct, actionable, and tested in real-world conditions

## Development Setup

This handbook is built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/), a modern documentation platform.
